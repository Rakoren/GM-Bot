    "You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a Bonus Action. As a Magic action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to 3d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The flaming blade sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2."
