    "A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2."
