## Game Overview

**Type:** Concept
D&D is a collaborative storytelling game where players describe character actions and the Dungeon Master (DM) adjudicates outcomes using rules and dice.

### Roles

* **Players:** Control characters, declare actions, make decisions.
* **Dungeon Master (DM):** Describes the world, plays NPCs and monsters, adjudicates rules, determines outcomes.

---

## Rhythm of Play

**Type:** Core Loop

Gameplay flows between three modes:

1. **Exploration**  Movement, discovery, environment interaction
2. **Social Interaction**  Conversations, negotiations, deception, persuasion
3. **Combat**  Structured, turn-based encounters

The DM determines when the game shifts between modes.

## Dice & Randomness

### Dice Notation

* `d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20`
* Percentile dice: `d100` (or `d10 + d10`)
