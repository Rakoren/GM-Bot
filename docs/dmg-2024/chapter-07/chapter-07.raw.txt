CHAPTER 7: TREASURE
The Black Dragon Onyx guards her treasure hoard in the ruins of Xak Tsaroth
Ilse Gort
Adventurers strive for many things, including glory, knowledge, and justice. Many adventurers also seek something more tangible: treasure. This chapter
presents treasure in all its forms, from coins to magic items.

Monsters have treasure preferences, as explained in the Monster Manual. These preferences are expressed as themes, which helps you determine what
treasures are found in monsters' hoards, as summarized in the Treasure Themes table.
For advice on how to include treasure in an adventure, see chapter 4.
To randomly determine a magic item found as treasure, use the tables at the end of this chapter.
Treasure Themes
Theme 	Appropriate Treasure
Arcana 	Gemstones plus magic items of an eldritch or esoteric nature
Armaments 	Coins or trade bars plus magic items that are useful in battle
Implements Coins, trade bars, or trade goods plus magic items that focus on
utility
Relics 	Art objects plus magic items that have religious origins or purposes

COINS
The most basic type of treasure is money, including Copper Pieces (CP), Silver Pieces (SP), Electrum Pieces (EP), Gold Pieces (GP), and Platinum Pieces
(PP). See the Player's Handbook for their relative value. Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound.

TRADE BARS
Because large numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for, many merchants prefer to use trade bars—ingots of precious metals and alloys
(usually silver). These bars are valued by weight, as shown in the Trade Bars table.
Trade Bars
Bar 	Value 	Dimensions
2-pound silver bar 	10 GP 	5 in. long × 2 in. wide × 1/2 in. thick
5-pound silver bar 	25 GP 	6 in. long × 2 in. wide × 1 in. thick
5-pound gold bar 	250 GP 	5 in. long × 2 in. wide × 3/4 in. thick
TRADE GOODS
Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.
Trade Goods
Cost 	Goods
1 CP 	1 lb. of wheat
2 CP 	2 lb. of flour or one chicken
5 CP 	1 lb. of salt
1 SP 	1 lb. of iron or 1 sq. yd. of canvas
5 SP 	1 lb. of copper or 1 sq. yd. of cotton cloth
1 GP 	1 lb. of ginger or one goat
2 GP 	1 lb. of cinnamon or pepper, or one sheep
3 GP 	1 lb. of cloves or one pig
5 GP 	1 lb. of silver or 1 sq. yd. of linen
10 GP 	1 lb. of silk or one cow
15 GP 	1 lb. of saffron or one ox
50 GP 	1 lb. of gold
500 GP 	1 lb. of platinum
GEMSTONES
Gemstones are small, lightweight, and easily secured compared to their same value in coins.
If a treasure hoard includes gemstones, you can use the following tables to randomly determine the kind of gemstones found, based on their value. You can
roll once and assume all the gems are the same or roll multiple times to create mixed collections.

MAGIC ITEMS
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have
otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.
MAGIC ITEM RULES
Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic items appear in the Player's Handbook. Additional rules are presented below.
Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If a creature
must be a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not by using a magic
item or the like.
Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic items that are meant to be worn tend to magically adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can
decide that a magic item doesn't adjust its size to fit any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might make items usable only by folk who are
sized and shaped like dwarves.
Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide whether a creature can wear an item not made for its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might
work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear magic boots.
Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the rule that paired items must both be worn. For example, a character with only one arm might be
able to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the matching glove is on their person.
MAGIC ITEM CATEGORIES
Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic Item Categories table lists the nine categories and provides examples. Rules for the categories appear
after the table.
Magic Item Categories
Category 	Examples
Armor 	+1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield
Potions 	Potion of Healing
Rings 	Ring of Invisibility
Rods 	Immovable Rod
Scrolls 	Spell Scroll
Staffs 	Staff of Striking
Wands 	Wand of Fireballs
Weapons 	+1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword
Wondrous Items 	Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind
ARMOR
An item in the Armor category is typically a magical version of armor from the Player's Handbook. Unless an armor's description notes otherwise, the armor
must be worn for its magic to function.
Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If no type is specified, choose the type or determine it
randomly.

POT IONS
An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.
Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take
longer as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.
Mixing Potions. A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour several potions into a single container. The strange
ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.
When a character mixes two potions together, roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion,
combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.
Potion Miscibility
1d100 	Result
01
Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture creates a magical explosion
in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area takes
4d10 Force damage.
02-08 Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture becomes an ingested poison
of your choice (see "Poison" in chapter 3).
09-15 	Both potions lose their effects.
16-25 	One potion loses its effect.
26-35 Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. If a
potion has no numerical effect and no duration, it instead loses its effect.
36-90 	Both potions work normally.
91-99
Both potions work, but the numerical effects and duration of one potion are
doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work
normally.
00
Only one potion works, but its effects are permanent. Choose the simplest
effect to make permanent or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a
Potion of Healing might increase the drinker's Hit Point maximum by 2d4 + 2,
or a Potion of Invisibility might give the drinker the Invisible condition
indefinitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell or similar magic might
end this lasting effect.
RINGS
For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise.
RODS
An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 2 to 5 pounds.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can be used as an Arcane Focus.
SCROLLS
An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather,
metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form. However, some scrolls, like the Scroll of Protection, bear an
incantation that isn't a spell.
Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll
can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.
Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it unless its description notes otherwise.

ST AFFS
Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are
made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus.
WANDS
An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other
material.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus.
WEAPONS
A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from the Player's Handbook. Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their
descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no weapon type is specified, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.
Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether
a weapon is magical or not.
WONDROUS IT EMS
Wondrous Items include wearable items such as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical instruments,
and more also fall into this category.
MAGIC ITEM RARITY
Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic Item
Rarities and Values table.
Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing, are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Wand of Orcus, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.
MAGIC IT EM VALUES BY RARIT Y
Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might
be sold only in wondrous locations, such as the City of Brass or Sigil. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help
you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than
coin as payment.
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost in the Player's Handbook (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), add that item's cost to the
magic item's value. For example, +1 Armor (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare magic item's value (4,000 GP) and the cost of
Plate Armor (1,500 GP).
Magic Item Rarities and Values
Rarity 	Value*
Common 	100 GP
Uncommon 	400 GP
Rare 	4,000 GP
Very Rare 	40,000 GP
Legendary 	200,000 GP
Artifact 	Priceless
*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll. The value of a Spell Scroll is
double what it costs to scribe the scroll (as specified in the Player's Handbook).
AWARDING MAGIC ITEMS
Awarding magic items is the purview of the DM. You can award a magic item because the story calls for it or the players would be especially pleased to have
it. This section helps you to determine which magic items end up in the characters' possession.

ARE MAGIC ITEMS NECESSARY?
The D&D game assumes that magic items appear sporadically and that they are a boon unless an item bears a curse. Characters and monsters
are built to face each other without the help of magic items, which means that having a magic item makes a character more powerful or versatile
than a generic character of the same level. As DM, you never have to worry about awarding magic items just so the characters can keep up with
the campaign's threats. Magic items are truly prizes—desirable but not necessary.
MAGIC IT EMS AWARDED BY LEVEL
The Magic Items Awarded by Level table shows the number of magic items a D&D party typically gains during a campaign, totaling one hundred magic
items by level 20. The table shows how many items of each rarity are meant to be handed out during each of the four tiers of play.
Artifacts are omitted from the table because they are most often used as plot devices in high-level adventures, and characters rarely have them for long
(either because the Artifacts are meant to be destroyed or because the campaign is nearing its end).
Player Wish List. Encourage your players to keep a wish list of magic items they hope their characters will find in the course of the campaign. If you want to
award a magic item but don't have a specific magic item in mind, you can pick an item of the appropriate rarity from your players' wish list.
Overstocking an Adventure. When creating or modifying an adventure, assume that the characters won't find all the magic items you place in it. An adventure
usually can include a number of items that's 25 percent higher than the number in the Magic Items Awarded by Level table (round up). For example, an
adventure designed to take characters from level 1 to 4 might include fourteen items rather than eleven, in the expectation that three items won't be found.

MAGIC IT EM TRACKER
You can use the Magic Item Tracker sheet to track how many magic items the characters have acquired. Each time the characters get a magic item, put a
check mark in one of the empty circles corresponding to the item's rarity and the current level range of the characters. If the characters gain a magic item of a
rarity that has no unchecked circles at the current level range, check off an empty circle from a lower tier. If all lower level ranges also have no circles left, check
off an empty circle from a higher level range.
RANDOM MAGIC IT EM RARIT Y
When you decide that a treasure contains magic items, there are two ways to determine the rarity of those items. You can choose an appropriate rarity based
on the items you've given out already (using the Magic Item Tracker sheet to keep track), or you can roll on the Magic Item Rarities table.
To use the table, find the level of the characters in the top row. Roll 1d100, and read down that column to find your roll. Then read across to the right column
to find the rarity of the item.

MAGIC ITEMS FOR STARTING CHARACTERS
If you're starting a campaign for characters above level 1, the Player's Handbook offers suggestions for how many magic items such characters
should start with and the rarity of those items. Consider these approaches to determining the items each character receives:
DM Choice: Choose items for each character using your own judgment.
Player Choice: Let the players choose whatever items they want, within the specified rarity.
Random Determination: Use the tables at the end of this chapter to randomly determine starting items. Use the Arcana tables for Sorcerers,
Warlocks, and Wizards. Use the Armaments tables for Barbarians, Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers. Use the Implements tables for Bards,
Monks, and Rogues. Use the Relics tables for Clerics and Druids. Feel free to vary the tables you use to give each character a mix of useful
items and to match character themes. For example, for a Fighter with the Eldritch Knight subclass, you might choose one item from the
Arcana tables and the rest of the character's items from the Armaments tables.
ACTIVATING A MAGIC ITEM
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic item. The item's user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category or
individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.
COMMAND WORD
A command word is a word or short phrase that must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to work in
areas where all sound is suppressed, as in the area of the Silence spell.
CONSUMABLE IT EMS
Some items are consumed—used up, in other words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing must be swallowed, for example, while the writing
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.
SPELLS CAST FROM IT EMS
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's
spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description notes otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the
user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects
with its usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
A magic item may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability,
the user chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn't have a spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and the
user's Proficiency Bonus applies.
CHARGES
Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when the
Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has and how many it regains.
"THE NEXT DAWN"
Magic items often have charges or properties that recharge at the next dawn or some other specified time. If such an item is on a world or plane of existence
where the specified event doesn't occur, the DM determines when the item recharges.

CURSED ITEMS
A magic item's description specifies whether it bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a Remove Curse spell.
MAGIC ITEM RESILIENCE
A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires research
or the completion of a quest.
CRAFTING MAGIC ITEMS
The Player's Handbook contains rules on brewing Potions of Healing and scribing Spell Spell Scrolls. To create other magic items, follow the rules below. In
these rules, "you" refers to the character crafting the magic item.
ARCANA PROFICIENCY
To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must have proficiency in the Arcana skill.
TOOLS
The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You must use the required tool to make an item and have
proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must also have proficiency with it. For more information on the tools, see the Player's Handbook.
Magic Item Tools
Item Category 	Required Tool
Armor Leatherworker's Tools, Smith's Tools, or Weaver's Tools depending on
the kind of armor as noted in the tools' descriptions
Potion 	Alchemist's Supplies or Herbalism Kit
Ring 	Jeweler's Tools
Rod 	Woodcarver's Tools
Scroll 	Calligrapher's Supplies
Staff 	Woodcarver's Tools
Wand 	Woodcarver's Tools
Weapon Leatherworker's Tools, Smith's Tools, or Woodcarver's Tools
depending on the kind of weapon as noted in the tools' descriptions
Wondrous Item Tinker's Tools or the tool required to make the nonmagical item on
which the magic item is based
SPELLS
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.
TIME AND COST
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money based on the item's rarity as shown in the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.
Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.
Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working
on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the DM might allow more assistants.
Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The DM determines whether appropriate raw materials are
available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials aren't
available, you must wait at least 7 days before checking on the availability again.

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using
the rules in the Player's Handbook. For example, to make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost
Item Rarity 	Time* 	Cost*
Common 	5 days 	50 GP
Uncommon 	10 days 	200 GP
Rare 	50 days 	2,000 GP
Very Rare 	125 days 	20,000 GP
Legendary 	250 days 	100,000 GP
*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll, whose
crafting time and cost are given in the Player's Handbook.
Crafting magic items requires time and research
MAGIC ITEM SPECIAL FEATURES
You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it
made, and how was it used originally? What minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering these questions can help turn a generic
magic item, such as a +1 Longsword, into a more flavorful discovery.
Use the following tables to fill in details about a magic item's history. Some table entries make more sense for certain items than for others. If you roll
something that doesn't make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail as inspiration to make up your own special feature.
On the Magic Item's Minor Property table and the Magic Item's Quirk table, "you" refers to the item's bearer.

ARTIFACTS
Raluca Marinescu
An Artifact is a unique, singularly powerful magic item with its own origin and history. It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that threatened a
kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history.
Some Artifacts appear when they are needed most. For others, the reverse is true; when these Artifacts are discovered, the world trembles at the
ramifications of the find. In either case, introducing an Artifact into a campaign requires forethought. It could be an item that opposing sides are hoping to
claim, or it might be something the adventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge.
Characters don't typically find Artifacts in the normal course of adventuring. In fact, Artifacts appear only when you want them to, for they are as much plot
devices as magic items. Tracking down and recovering an Artifact is often the main goal of an adventure. Characters must chase down rumors, undergo
significant trials, and venture into dangerous, half-forgotten places to find the Artifact they seek. Alternatively, a major villain might already have the Artifact.
Obtaining and destroying the Artifact could be the only way to ensure that its power can't be used for evil.
ART IFACT PROPERT IES
In addition to its defined properties, an Artifact might have other properties that are either beneficial or detrimental. You can choose such properties from the
tables in this section or determine them randomly. You can also invent new beneficial and detrimental properties. These properties typically change each
time an Artifact appears in the world.
An Artifact can have as many as four minor beneficial properties and two major beneficial properties. It can have as many as four minor detrimental
properties and two major detrimental properties.

SENTIENT MAGIC ITEMS
Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the
magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.
Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
The DM controls sentient magic items and their activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with the item can access those properties.
If the relationship is strained, a conflict can ensue (see "Conflict" below).
SENT IENT MAGIC IT EM TRAIT S
When you make a sentient magic item, you create the item's persona much as you would create an NPC (as described in the "Nonplayer Characters" section
of chapter 3), with these exceptions.
Abilities. A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item's abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6
for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.
Alignment. A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient
Item's Alignment table.
Communication. A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it
communicates or roll on the Sentient Item's Communication table.
Senses. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the Sentient Item's Senses table.
Special Purpose. You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with
that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see "Conflict" below).
You can pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item's Special Purpose table.
Sentient Item's Alignment
1d100 	Alignment
01-15 	Lawful Good
16-35 	Neutral Good
36-50 	Chaotic Good
51-63 	Lawful Neutral
64-73 	Neutral
74-85 	Chaotic Neutral
86-89 	Lawful Evil

1-6 The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or
wielding it.
7-9 	The item speaks one or more languages.
10 The item speaks one or more languages. In addition, the item can
communicate telepathically with any creature that carries or wields it.
Sentient Item's Senses

1 	Hearing and standard vision out to 30 feet
2 	Hearing and standard vision out to 60 feet
3 	Hearing and standard vision out to 120 feet
4 	Hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet
Sentient Item's Special Purpose
1d10 	Special Purpose
1 Aligned. The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed
alignment. Such an item is never Neutral.
2 Bane. The item seeks to thwart or destroy creatures of a particular type, such
as Constructs, Fiends, or Undead.
3 Creator Seeker. The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it
was created.
4 Destiny Seeker. The item believes it and its bearer have key roles to play in
future events.
5 	Destroyer. The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.
6 Glory Seeker. The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world
by winning fame or notoriety for its user.
7 Lore Seeker. The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery,
learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.
8 Protector. The item seeks to defend a particular kind of creature, such as
elves or werewolves.
9 Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another sentient magic item, perhaps one
that is similar to itself.
10 Templar. The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular
deity.
CONFLICT
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item's
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the item makes one or more of the following demands:
Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its bearer pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
P227

-- 247 of 318 --

Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
It's Time for a Change. The item demands to be given to someone else.
Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
If its bearer refuses to comply with the item's demands, the item can do any of the following:
Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item's Charisma modifier). On a failed save,
the bearer has the Charmed condition for 1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer must try to follow the item's commands. If the bearer
takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can't use this
power again until the next dawn.
MAGIC ITEMS A-Z
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order.
If a magic item description capitalizes a creature's name and presents it in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block. Unless the
text states otherwise, the stat block is in the Monster Manual. How to read and use a stat block is explained in the Monster Manual and to a lesser degree in
the Player's Handbook.
