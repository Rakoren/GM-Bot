    "Conflict arises when a bearer acts against the item's alignment or purpose.",
    "On conflict, the bearer makes a Charisma save (DC 12 + item's Charisma modifier).",
    "On a failed save, the item issues demands; refusal can block attunement, suppress properties, or attempt control.",
    "If the item attempts control and the save fails, the bearer is Charmed for 1d12 hours and must try to follow the item's commands; repeat the save on taking damage."
