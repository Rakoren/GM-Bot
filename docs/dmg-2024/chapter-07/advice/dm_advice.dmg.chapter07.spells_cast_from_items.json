    "Spells cast from items use the lowest possible spell and caster level unless noted otherwise.",
    "Casting from an item doesn't expend the user's spell slots and needs no components unless specified.",
    "The spell uses normal casting time, range, and duration; concentration is required if the spell requires it.",
    "Some items bypass casting and confer effects directly; exceptions can alter casting time, duration, or other parts.",
    "If a spellcasting ability is required, the user chooses which one to use; if none, the modifier is +0 and Proficiency Bonus applies."
