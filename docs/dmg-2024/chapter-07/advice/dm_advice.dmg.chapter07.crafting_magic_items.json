    "Crafting time and cost depend on rarity (see the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table).",
    "You must work 8 hours per day; days need not be consecutive.",
    "Assistants can reduce time; divide time by the number of crafters (normally one assistant).",
    "Materials cost represents raw materials; availability is 75% in cities and 25% elsewhere, and you can check again after 7 days if unavailable."
