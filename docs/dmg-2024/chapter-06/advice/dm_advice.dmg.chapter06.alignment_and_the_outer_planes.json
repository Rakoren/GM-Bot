    "Let long exposure to a plane?s ethos influence behavior; treat it as DM guidance and reward roleplay with Heroic Inspiration.",
    "For Celestials and Fiends on opposed planes, you can apply planar dissonance: after a Long Rest, a DC 10 Constitution save; on a failure, subtract 1d4 from D20 Tests until a Long Rest on a non-opposed plane; failures stack.",
    "Use these effects sparingly to emphasize the planes as realms of thought and morality."
