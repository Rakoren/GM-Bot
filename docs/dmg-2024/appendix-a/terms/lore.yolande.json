  "description": [
    "YOLANDE (yoh-LAWND), known as the Faerie Queen, is the benevolent and beloved elf monarch of Celene (see chapter 5). Raised in the court of the Summer Queen, Yolande had no wish to rule. She preferred the life of an adventuring magic-user. She built her reputation on triumphs, such as her capture of the fomorian brigand Solgna and the theft of the Prince of Frost's sentient sword, Winterflash. Yolande was among the first elves to migrate from the Feywild to the Greyhawk setting. ✏"
