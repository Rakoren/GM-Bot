    "Kas (KOSS) is a vampire, legendary sword-fighter, and ruthless warlord. He once served as the leader of Vecna's armies and the lich's most trusted lieutenant, and he wielded a sword made for him (the Sword of Kas, described in chapter 7) by his liege. But the evil sword convinced Kas to betray Vecna, and now Kas is driven primarily by his hatred for his former lord."
