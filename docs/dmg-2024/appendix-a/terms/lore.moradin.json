    "Myths told on many worlds describe Moradin (MORE-ah-din) crafting all the peoples of the Material Plane in his great workshop in Mount Celestia (see chapter 6), causing them to spring to life from inert metal when he cooled the heated castings with his breath. These myths are the source of Moradin's appellation, \"All-Father.\" Many peoples across the multiverse, including many dwarves, worship Moradin."
