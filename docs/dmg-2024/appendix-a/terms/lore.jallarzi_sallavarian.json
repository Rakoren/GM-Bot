    "The youngest and most recently appointed member of the Circle of Eight (see chapter 5), Jallarzi Sallavarian (juh-LAR-zee sal-ah-VAIR-ee-en) is a Warlock with a celestial patron. She is more inclined toward good than the more neutral members of the Circle of Eight and enjoys wandering the Free City of Greyhawk (see chapter 5) in disguise, monitoring sinister elements of society there."
