  "description": [
    "IUZ (EYE-ooze or eye-OOZE) is a cambion and the son of Iggwilv and Graz'zt (see chapter 6). He is every bit as evil as his father and as bent on conquest as his mother at her very worst. He rules a significant portion of Eastern Oerik (in the Greyhawk setting), and some fear that he aspires to conquer even more territory. See \"Greyhawk's Premise\" in chapter 5. ✏"
