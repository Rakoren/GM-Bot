    "DIANCASTRA (DIE-ann-CAST-rah) is a demigod and a daughter of the divine ancestor of giants, Annam. She is a trickster, an adventurer, and a scholar of magic who enjoys wandering the Material Plane in search of new curiosities and spells to learn. She longs to see the descendants of Annam-storm, cloud, fire, frost, stone, and hill giants-restored to the position of honor and respect they held in ancient times."
