    "MORDENKAINEN (mor-den-KIGH-nen or mor-den-KAY-nen) is a human archmage who maintains a residence in the Free City of Greyhawk and another hidden somewhere in the Yatil Mountains between Perrenland and Ket (see chapter 5). He is the founder and leader of the Circle of Eight, which he created to implement his philosophy of balance in the world. Among Mordenkainen's celebrated accomplishments are several name-branded spells, including ones that create extradimensional mansions, swords of spectral force, and phantom watchdogs (detailed in the Player's Handbook). Mordenkainen has visited numerous worlds and planes of existence, making friends and fomenting rivalries on many of them. He maintains a close friendship with his former apprentice Bigby and the famous archmage Elminster of Shadowdale. Mordenkainen's greatest rival is Iggwilv, a former adventuring companion."
