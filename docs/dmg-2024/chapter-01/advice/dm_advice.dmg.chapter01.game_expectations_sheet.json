    "The Game Expectations tracking sheet is a tool you can use to set expectations at the start of a game and ensure the game is fun for everyone.",
    "Before distributing the sheet to players, fill in the two topmost boxes: Game Theme and Flavor, and Potentially Sensitive Elements.",
    "Once the above information is added, give a copy of the sheet to each player. Players can fill out their sheets anonymously, but ask each of them to add limits and hopes/expectations/concerns.",
    "Collect all the sheets, and gather your players' limits into a separate, anonymous document the whole group can access."
