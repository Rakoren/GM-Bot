    "Sometimes the hardest thing about running a game is finding a time when everyone can play. Some groups play for a few hours every week, while others set aside a whole day once a month. Create a schedule that works best for your group.",
    "For new groups, it often helps to schedule a single-session game (often called a \"one-shot\") as a way for people to try it out. If everyone has a great time at that one session, it can be easier to get them to make a long-term commitment.",
    "Scheduling conflicts are sometimes inescapable. The \"Group Size\" section in chapter 2 offers some advice on what to do when a player has to miss a session."
