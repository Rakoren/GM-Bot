    "The bulk of a typical D&D session consists of a series of encounters, similar to how a movie is a series of scenes.",
    "In each encounter, there are chances for the DM to describe creatures and places and for characters to make choices.",
    "Encounters can involve exploration (interacting with the environment, including puzzles), social interaction with creatures, or combat.",
    "The Player's Handbook outlines the general rhythm of play in an encounter. The following sections offer more detailed information on how an encounter typically unfolds, in three steps."
