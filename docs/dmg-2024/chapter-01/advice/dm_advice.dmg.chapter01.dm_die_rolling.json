    "Should you hide your die rolls behind a DM screen, or should you roll your dice in the open for all the players to see? Choose either approach, and be consistent. Each approach has benefits:",
    "Hidden Die Rolls. Hiding your die rolls keeps them mysterious and allows you to alter results if you want to. For example, you could ignore a Critical Hit to save a character's life. Do not alter die rolls too often, though, and never let the players know when you fudge a die roll.",
    "Visible Die Rolls. Rolling dice in the open demonstrates impartiality?you are not fudging rolls to the characters' benefit or detriment.",
    "Even if you usually roll behind a screen, it can be fun to make an especially dramatic roll where everyone can see it."
