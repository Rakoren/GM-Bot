    "The most important part of being a good DM is facilitating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep these tips in mind to help things go smoothly.",
    "Embrace the Shared Story. D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the other players contribute through the words and deeds of their characters.",
    "Encourage players to engage by asking them what their characters are doing.",
    "It's Not a Competition. The DM isn't competing against the other players. It's your job to provide fun challenges and keep the story moving.",
    "Be Fair and Flexible. Treat your players in a fair, impartial manner. The rules help you do this, but when you need to act as referee, try to make decisions that ensure everyone is having fun.",
    "Communicate with Your Players. Open communication is essential to a successful D&D game. Many problems can be solved or even prevented with honest conversation. Ask questions and solicit feedback after or between sessions.",
    "It's OK to Make Mistakes. If you overlook or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. No one expects you to memorize every rule or detail.",
    "Even if you don't realize your mistake until after a game session is over, it's OK to acknowledge the mistake at the start of the next session and make adjustments moving forward."
