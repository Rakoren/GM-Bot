    "Some players enjoy poring over the D&D rules and looking for optimal combinations. This kind of optimizing is part of the game, but it can cross a line into being exploitative, interfering with everyone else's fun.",
    "Setting clear expectations is essential when dealing with this kind of rules exploitation. Bear these principles in mind:",
    "Rules Aren't Physics. The rules of the game are meant to provide a fun game experience, not to describe the laws of physics in the worlds of D&D, let alone the real world.",
    "The Game Is Not an Economy. The rules of the game are not intended to model a realistic economy, and players who look for loopholes that let them generate infinite wealth using combinations of spells are exploiting the rules.",
    "Combat Is for Enemies. Some rules apply only during combat or while a character is acting in Initiative order. Do not let players attack each other or helpless creatures to activate those rules.",
    "Rules Rely on Good-Faith Interpretation. The rules assume that everyone reading and interpreting the rules has the interests of the group's fun at heart and is reading the rules in that light.",
    "Outlining these principles can help hold players' exploits at bay. If a player persistently tries to twist the rules of the game, have a conversation with that player outside the game and ask them to stop."
