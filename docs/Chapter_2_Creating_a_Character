> **Source:** Player’s Handbook – Chapter 2 (D&D 5e 2024)
> **Purpose:** Defines the step-by-step process for creating, advancing, and customizing a character.

## Character Creation Overview

Creating a character combines **mechanics** and **roleplay**. The result is a playable character sheet used to resolve actions in the game.

### Session Zero (DM Guidance)

The DM may run a Session Zero to establish tone, expectations, boundaries, and party cohesion before characters are finalized.

## Character Creation Pipeline

**Type:** Procedural Rule

Characters are created in the following order:

1. Choose a Class
2. Determine Origin (Background)
3. Choose a Species
4. Determine Ability Scores
5. Choose Alignment
6. Fill in Numbers
7. Describe the Character

---

## Step 1: Choose a Class

A class defines your character’s core abilities and combat role.

**Class Properties:**

* Primary Ability
* Hit Die
* Proficiencies
* Class Features

Characters typically start at **Level 1** unless the DM specifies otherwise.

---

## Step 2: Determine Origin (Background)

A background represents a character’s history and grants:

* Skill proficiencies
* Tool proficiency
* Languages
* A background feat

Backgrounds influence ability score placement.

---

## Step 3: Choose a Species

A species represents ancestry and grants:

* Ability score increases
* Languages
* Special traits

Players may freely describe appearance regardless of species mechanics.

---

## Step 4: Determine Ability Scores

Ability scores define a character’s physical and mental capabilities.

### Ability Score Methods

* **Standard Array:** 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
* **Point Buy:** Spend points to raise scores
* **Rolling:** Roll dice (DM approval)

### Ability Modifiers

Modifiers are derived from ability scores and applied to rolls.

---

## Step 5: Choose Alignment

Alignment reflects a character’s moral and ethical outlook.

### Alignment Axes

* Lawful / Neutral / Chaotic
* Good / Neutral / Evil

Alignment is descriptive, not restrictive.

---

## Step 6: Fill in Numbers

Finalize mechanical statistics:

* Hit Points
* Proficiency Bonus
* Armor Class
* Attacks and damage
* Saving Throws
* Passive Perception

---

## Step 7: Describe Your Character

Players define:

* Appearance
* Personality traits
* Ideals, bonds, flaws
* Backstory hooks

Roleplay choices do not alter mechanics unless stated.

---

## Equipment

Characters gain starting equipment from their class and background, or may purchase gear using starting gold (DM option).

---

## Advancement & Leveling

### Gaining Levels

Characters advance by earning Experience Points (XP) or by DM milestone leveling.

### On Level Up

* Increase Hit Points
* Gain class features
* Increase proficiency bonus when applicable

---

## Multiclassing (Optional Rule)

Characters may gain levels in multiple classes if they meet prerequisites.

**Key Rules:**

* Track levels per class
* Use total character level for proficiency bonus
* Spell slots may be shared across classes

---

## Design Note

This chapter defines **character state and progression**, which later chapters modify. All class, spell, and equipment rules build on this structure.
