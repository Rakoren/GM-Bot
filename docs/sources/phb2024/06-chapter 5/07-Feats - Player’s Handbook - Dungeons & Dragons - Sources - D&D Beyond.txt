Chapter 5: Feats
This chapter offers a collection of feats, which are special features not tied to a character class. A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives
a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

Your background gives you a feat, and at certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feat or the choice of another feat for which you
qualify.
By whatever means you acquire a feat, you can take it only once unless its description says otherwise.
Feat Descriptions
This chapter’s feats are organized by category—Origin, General, Fighting Style, or Epic Boon—and alphabetized in each category. All the feats are listed
alphabetically in the Feat List table. If a feat can be taken more than once, an asterisk appears after its name in that table.
Parts of a Feat
The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat’s name.
Category. A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you’re instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin
category, that category must appear under the feat’s name. If you’re instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any
category.
Prerequisite. To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a
prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat.
Benefit. The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits.
Repeatable. A feat can be taken only once unless its description states otherwise in a “Repeatable” subsection.
