Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before
nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that
turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.
Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they
wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.
Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation.
Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these
blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

Level 1: Lay On Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total
number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that
creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.
You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit
Points to the creature.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class’s description.
Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin
spells.
Heroism and
Searing Smite are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The
chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin
spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have
spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Longswords and Javelins.

-- 6 of 97 --

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of
Halberds and Flails.
Level 2: Fighting Style
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5 for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.
Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list of Cleric spells).
Guidance and
Sacred Flame are
recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level,
you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.
Level 2: Paladin’s Smite
You always have the
Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can
cast it in this way again.
Level 3: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is
described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which
effect from this class to create.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the
Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same
radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the
Hallow spell.
Level 3: Paladin Subclass
You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed
after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of
your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin
levels 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Faithful Steed
You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the
Find Steed spell prepared.

-- 7 of 97 --

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Aura of Protection
You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.
You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.
Level 9: Abjure Foes
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you
can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do
only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.
Level 10: Aura of Courage
You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no
effect on that ally while there.
Level 11: Radiant Strikes
Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra
1d8 Radiant damage.
Level 14: Restoring Touch
When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened,
Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those
points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

Level 18: Aura Expansion
Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.

Paladin Subclasses
A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Oath of
Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and Oath of Vengeance subclasses.
Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination
of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others,
the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.
Oath of Devotion
Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order.
These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or
worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use
their gods’ tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels
as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or
coats of arms.
These paladins share the following tenets:
Let your word be your promise.
Protect the weak and never fear to act.
Let your honorable deeds be an example.
Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when
you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Sacred Weapon
OATH OF DEVOTION SUBCLASS
ARTIST: KATERINA LADON

-- 11 of 97 --

When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy.
For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and
each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.
The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the weapon.
Level 7: Aura of Devotion
You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect
on that ally while there.
Level 15: Smite of Protection
Your magical smite now radiates protective energy. Whenever you cast
Divine Smite, you and your allies have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection.
The aura has this benefit until the start of your next turn.
Level 20: Holy Nimbus
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action
required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot
(no action required).
Holy Ward. You have Advantage on any saving throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an Undead.
Radiant Damage. Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Proficiency
Bonus.
Sunlight. The aura is filled with Bright Light that is sunlight.
Oath of Glory
Strive for the Heights of Heroism
Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and
encourage their companions, so they’re all ready when destiny calls.
ARTIST: POLAR ENGINE

-- 12 of 97 --

These paladins share the following tenets:
Endeavor to be known by your deeds.
Face hardships with courage.
Inspire others to strive for glory.
Level 3: Inspiring Smite
Immediately after you cast
Divine Smite, you can expend one use of your Channel
Divinity and distribute Temporary Hit Points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet
of yourself, which can include you. The total number of Temporary Hit Points equals
2d8 plus your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.
Level 3: Oath of Glory Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach
a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Peerless Athlete
As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For 1 hour, you have Advantage on Strength (Athletics)
and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and the distance of your Long and High Jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).
Level 7: Aura of Alacrity
Your Speed increases by 10 feet.
In addition, whenever an ally enters your Aura of Protection for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, the ally’s Speed increases by 10 feet until the
end of their next turn.
Level 15: Glorious Defense
You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to
grant a bonus to the target’s AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack
misses, you can make one attack with a weapon against the attacker as part of this Reaction if the attacker is within your weapon’s range.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
Level 20: Living Legend
You can empower yourself with the legends—whether true or exaggerated—of your great deeds. As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10
minutes. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot
OATH OF GLORY SUBCLASS

-- 13 of 97 --

(no action required).
Charismatic. You are blessed with an otherworldly presence and have Advantage on all Charisma checks.
Saving Throw Reroll. If you fail a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.
Unerring Strike. Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
Oath of the Ancients
Preserve Life and Light in the World
The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves. Paladins who swear this oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world
more than any principles of honor, courage, and justice. They often adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or
flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light.
These paladins share the following tenets:
Kindle the light of hope.
Shelter life.
Delight in art and laughter.
Level 3: Nature’s Wrath
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to conjure spectral vines
around nearby creatures. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of
yourself must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1
minute. A Restrained creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
Level 3: Oath of the Ancients Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a
Paladin level specified in the Oath of the Ancients Spells table, you thereafter always have the
listed spells prepared.

beyond the Material Plane; you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and
Radiant damage while in your Aura of Protection.
OATH OF THE ANCIENTS SUBCLASS
ARTIST: POLAR ENGINE

-- 14 of 97 --

Level 15: Undying Sentinel
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to three times
your Paladin level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Additionally, you can’t be aged magically, and you cease visibly aging.
Level 20: Elder Champion
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with primal power, granting the benefits below for 1 minute or until you end them (no action
required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot
(no action required).
Diminish Defiance. Enemies in the aura have Disadvantage on saving throws against your spells and Channel Divinity options.
Regeneration. At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 Hit Points.
Swift Spells. Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can cast it using a Bonus Action instead.
Oath of Vengeance
Punish Evildoers at Any Cost
The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers,
when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these,
paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.
ARTIST: IGNATIUS BUDI

-- 15 of 97 --

These paladins share the following tenets:
Show the wicked no mercy.
Fight injustice and its causes.
Aid those harmed by injustice.

Level 3: Vow of Enmity
When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to
utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You
have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this
feature again.
If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a
different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).
Level 7: Relentless Avenger
Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, you can reduce the creature’s Speed to 0
until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity
Attacks.
Level 15: Soul of Vengeance
Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to make a melee attack
against that creature if it’s within range.
Level 20: Avenging Angel
As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to
track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.
Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed
with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how
you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class’s description.
Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger
spells.
Cure Wounds and
Ensnaring Strike are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of
level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.
Level 1: Favored Enemy
You always have the
Hunter’s Mark spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability
when you finish a Long Rest.
The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of
the Ranger Features table.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Longbows and Shortswords.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of
Scimitars and Longswords.
Level 2: Deft Explorer

-- 19 of 97 --

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.
Expertise. Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in that skill.
Languages. You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in chapter 2.
Level 2: Fighting Style
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.
Druidic Warrior. You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a list of Druid spells).
Guidance and
Starry Wisp are
recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level,
you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.
Level 3: Ranger Subclass
You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice.The Beast Master, Fey Wanderer, Gloom Stalker, and Hunter subclasses are detailed after this class’s
description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s
features that are of your Ranger level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger
levels 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 6: Roving
Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.
Temporary Hit Points. As a Magic action, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of
1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
Decrease Exhaustion. Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.
Level 13: Relentless Hunter
Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on
Hunter’s Mark.

Ranger Subclasses
A Ranger subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Beast Master,
Fey Wanderer, Gloom Stalker, and Hunter subclasses.
Beast Master
Bond with a Primal Beast

-- 23 of 97 --

A Beast Master forms a mystical bond with a special animal, drawing on primal magic and a deep connection to the natural world.
Level 3: Primal Companion
You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond
with nature. Choose its stat block: Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast
of the Sky. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind
appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal
markings indicating its supernatural origin.
The beast is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It
vanishes if you die.
The Beast in Combat. In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and
use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless
you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some
other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack
action to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike action. If you have the
Incapacitated condition, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge
action.
Restoring or Replacing the Beast. If the beast has died within the last hour, you
can take a Magic action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to
life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can summon a different primal beast,
which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat
block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one
vanishes when the new one appears.

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just
about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine
skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.
In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of
blows.
Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal
or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

Level 1: Expertise
You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.
At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.
Level 1: Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if
you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.
You don’t need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition, and
you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.
Level 1: Thieves’ Cant
You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your choice,
which you choose from the language tables in chapter 2.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Daggers and Shortbows.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of
Scimitars and Shortswords.
Level 2: Cunning Action
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash,
Disengage, or Hide.
Level 3: Rogue Subclass
You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Arcane Trickster, Assassin, Soulknife, and Thief subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A
subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are
of your Rogue level or lower.
Level 3: Steady Aim
As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven’t moved during this
turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels
8, 10, 12, and 16.

-- 33 of 97 --

Level 5: Cunning Strike
You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects.
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before
rolling.
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.
Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit on your person.
Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
Level 5: Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down).
Level 7: Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the
Incapacitated condition.
Level 7: Reliable Talent
Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike
You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.
Level 14: Devious Strikes
You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.
ARTIST: BRYAN SOLA

-- 34 of 97 --

Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or
a Bonus Action.
Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.
Level 15: Slippery Mind
Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.
Level 18: Elusive
You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have Advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated
condition.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.
Level 20: Stroke of Luck
You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the roll into a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Rogue Subclasses
ARTIST: NATHANIEL HIMAWAN

-- 35 of 97 --

A Rogue subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels,
as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Arcane Trickster, Assassin,
Soulknife, and Thief subclasses.
Arcane Trickster
Enhance Stealth with Arcane Spells
Some Rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with spells, learning
magical tricks to aid them in their trade. Some Arcane Tricksters use their talents as
pickpockets and burglars, while others are pranksters.
Level 3: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The
information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.
Cantrips. You know three cantrips:
Mage Hand and two other cantrips of your choice
from the Wizard spell list (see that class’s section for its list).
Mind Sliver and
Minor
Illusion are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except
Mage
Hand, with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.
Spell Slots. The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard
spells.
Charm Person,
Disguise Self, and
Fog Cloud are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table.
Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster
Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells
can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.
Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain
When you cast
Mage Hand, you can cast it as a Bonus Action, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible. You can control the hand as a Bonus Action,
and through it, you can make Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.
Level 9: Magical Ambush
If you have the Invisible condition when you cast a spell on a creature, it has Disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same
turn.
Level 13: Versatile Trickster
You gain the ability to distract targets with your
Mage Hand. When you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that
option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.
Level 17: Spell Thief
You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.
Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an
Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the
spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature
can’t cast it until the 8 hours have passed.
Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.
ARTIST: BILLY CHRISTIAN

-- 37 of 97 --

Assassin
Practice the Grim Art of Death
An Assassin’s training focuses on using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While some Rogues who follow this path are
hired killers, spies, or bounty hunters, the capabilities of this subclass are equally useful for adventurers facing a variety of monstrous enemies.
ARTIST: IGNATIUS BUDI

-- 38 of 97 --

Level 3: Assassinate
You’re adept at ambushing a target, granting you the following benefits.
Initiative. You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.
Surprising Strikes. During the first round of each combat, you have Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. If your Sneak
Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon’s type equal to your Rogue level.
Level 3: Assassin’s Tools
You gain a Disguise Kit and a Poisoner’s Kit, and you have proficiency with them.
Level 9: Infiltration Expertise
You are expert at the following techniques that aid your infiltrations.
Masterful Mimicry. You can unerringly mimic another person’s speech, handwriting, or both if you have spent at least 1 hour studying them.
Roving Aim. Your Speed isn’t reduced to 0 by using Steady Aim.
Level 13: Envenom Weapons
When you use the Poison option of your Cunning Strike, the target also takes 2d6 Poison damage whenever it fails the saving throw. This damage ignores
Resistance to Poison damage.
Level 17: Death Strike
ASSASSIN SUBCLASS

-- 39 of 97 --

When you hit with your Sneak Attack on the first round of a combat, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity
modifier and Proficiency Bonus), or the attack’s damage is doubled against the target.
Soulknife
Strike Foes with Psionic Blades
A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic.
These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their
roguish work. As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since
childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure.
Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how
to manifest your power.
Level 3: Psionic Power
You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your
Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The
Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach
certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.
Soulknife Energy Dice
Rogue Level 	Die Size 	Number
3 	D6 	4
5 	D8 	6
9 	D8 	8
11 	D10 	8
13 	D10 	10
17 	D12 	12
Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as
specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.
You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.
Psi-Bolstered Knack. If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the
number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.
Psychic Whispers. You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a Magic action, choose one or more creatures you can see,
up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the
chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and
the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).
The first time you use this power after each Long Rest, you don’t expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.
Level 3: Psychic Blades
You can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action or make an Opportunity Attack, you can manifest a Psychic
Blade in your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:
Weapon Category: Simple Melee
SOULKNIFE SUBCLASS
ARTIST: YUHONG DING

-- 40 of 97 --

Damage on a Hit: 1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll
Properties: Finesse, Thrown (range 60/120 feet)
Mastery: Vex (you can use this property, and it doesn’t count against the number of properties you can use with Weapon Mastery)
The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals damage.
After you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if
your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4 instead of 1d6.
Level 9: Soul Blades
You can now use the following powers with your Psychic Blades.
Homing Strikes. If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to
the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.
Psychic Teleportation. As a Bonus Action, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied
space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.
Level 13: Psychic Veil
You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a Magic action, you gain the Invisible condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no
action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use
of it.
Level 17: Rend Mind
You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature’s mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can
force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the Stunned
condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore
your use of it.
Thief
ARTIST: EVYN FONG

-- 41 of 97 --

Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer
A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities
useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.
Level 3: Fast Hands
As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.
Sleight of Hand. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.
Use an Object. Take the Utilize action, or take the Magic action to use a magic item that requires that action.
Level 3: Second-Story Work
You’ve trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.
Climber. You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
Jumper. You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.
Level 9: Supreme Sneak
You gain the following Cunning Strike option.
Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6). If you have the Hide action’s Invisible condition, this attack doesn’t end that condition on you if you end the turn behind Three-
Quarters Cover or Total Cover.
THIEF SUBCLASS
ARTIST: JODIE MUIR

-- 42 of 97 --

Level 13: Use Magic Device
You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.
Attunement. You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
Charges. Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.
Scrolls. You can use any
Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it
reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful
check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.
Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes
You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your
normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

A DAZZLING MAGE FILLED WITH INNATE MAGIC

-- 44 of 97 --

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in
their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift.
So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the
origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.
Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate
magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned
to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.
Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People
who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules
with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice.
Light,
Prestidigitation,
Shocking Grasp, and
Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.
Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer
spells.
Burning Hands and
Detect Magic are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The
chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer
spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have
spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.
Level 1: Innate Sorcery
An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during
which you gain the following benefits:
The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 2: Font of Magic
You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical
effects.
You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t
have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.
Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).
Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of
creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.
Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.
Creating Spell Slots
Spell Slot Level 	Sorcery Point Cost 	Min. Sorcerer Level
1 	2 	2
2 	3 	3
3 	5 	5
4 	6 	7
5 	7 	9
Level 2: Metamagic
Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “Metamagic
Options” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of
Sorcery Points that it costs.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level
10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.
Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass
You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed
after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of
your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer
levels 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration
When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you
use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate
If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.
In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.
Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis
While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

Metamagic Options
The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.
Careful Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so,
spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically
succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.
Distant Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a
range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet.
Empowered Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

-- 48 of 97 --

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one),
and you must use the new rolls.
You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
Extended Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.
Heightened Spell
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves
against the spell.
Quickened Spell
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.
You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a
spell in this way.
Seeking Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.
You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
Subtle Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are
consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.
Transmuted Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other
listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.
Twinned Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell, such as
Charm Person, that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point
to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

Sorcerer Subclasses
A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Aberrant
Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses.

-- 54 of 97 --

Aberrant Sorcery
Wield Unnatural Psionic Power
An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power.
You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will
this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to
those who feel the stab of your mind?
Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you
were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted
with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred;
now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind
is aflame with it.
Level 3: Psionic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Psionic Spells table, you thereafter
always have the listed spells prepared.
Psionic Spells
Sorcerer
Level Spells
3
Arms of Hadar,
Calm Emotions,

Dissonant Whispers,

Hunger of Hadar,
Sending

Evard’s Black Tentacles,
Summon Aberration
9	
Rary’s Telepathic Bond,
Telekinesis
Level 3: Telepathic Speech
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of
yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.
The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a
different creature.
Level 6: Psionic Sorcery
When you cast any level 1+ spell from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery
Points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or Somatic components, and it requires no Material
components unless they are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in it.
Level 6: Psychic Defenses
You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed or Frightened condition.
Level 14: Revelation in Flesh
You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10
minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends.
ABERRANT SORCERY SUBCLASS
ARTIST: IGNATIUS BUDI

-- 55 of 97 --

Aquatic Adaptation. You gain a Swim Speed equal to twice your Speed, and you can breathe underwater. Gills grow from your neck or flare behind your
ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia.
Glistening Flight. You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or otherworldly light.
See the Invisible. You can see any Invisible creature within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind Total Cover. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing
sensory tendrils.
Wormlike Movement. Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as
narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the Grappled condition.
Level 18: Warping Implosion
You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a Magic action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately
after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a
creature takes 3d10 Force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as
possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.
Clockwork Sorcery
Channel Cosmic Forces of Order
The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from
Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork
efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the
machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your
ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the
power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and glorious
system.
Level 3: Clockwork Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Clockwork Spells table, you thereafter
always have the listed spells prepared.
Clockwork Spells

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly
determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your
Sorcerer spells.
Manifestations of Order
CLOCKWORK SORCERY SUBCLASS
ARTIST: OLIVIER BERNARD

-- 56 of 97 --

1d6 	Manifestation
1 	Spectral cogwheels hover behind you.
2 	The hands of a clock spin in your eyes.
3 	Your skin glows with a brassy sheen.
4 	Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body.
5 	Your Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism.
6 	The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic.
Level 3: Restore Balance
Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to
roll a d20 with Advantage or Disadvantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
Level 6: Bastion of Law
You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery
Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s
equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and
reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.
The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.
Level 14: Trance of Order
You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For
the duration, attack rolls against you can’t benefit from Advantage, and whenever you make a D20 Test, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a
10.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.
Level 18: Clockwork Cavalcade
You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a Magic action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot Cube originating from
you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within
the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action
required) to restore your use of it.
Heal. The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.
Repair. Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.
Dispel. Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.
Draconic Sorcery
Breathe the Magic of Dragons
Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your
ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that
was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.
ARTIST: LAUREN WALSH

-- 57 of 97 --

Level 3: Draconic Resilience
The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point
maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer
level.
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor,
your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.
Level 3: Draconic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter
always have the listed spells prepared.
Draconic Spells
Sorcerer
Level Spells
3	
Alter Self,
Chromatic Orb,
Command,
Dragon’s Breath
5	
Fear,
Fly
7	
Arcane Eye,
Charm Monster
9	
Legend Lore,
Summon Dragon
Level 6: Elemental Affinity
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons.
Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals
damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that
spell.
Level 14: Dragon Wings
As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.
Level 18: Dragon Companion
You can cast
Summon Dragon without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that
casting.
DRACONIC SORCERY SUBCLASS
ARTIST: EKATERINA BURMAK

-- 58 of 97 --

Wild Magic Sorcery
Unleash Chaotic Magic
Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation.
You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a
planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a
fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent
cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
Level 3: Wild Magic Surge
Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll
1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll
on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.
If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.
Level 3: Tides of Chaos
You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself Advantage on one D20 Test before
you roll the d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or
finish a Long Rest before you can use this feature again.
If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a Long Rest, you
automatically roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.
Level 6: Bend Luck
You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the d20 for a D20 Test, you can take a
Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.
Level 14: Controlled Chaos
You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either
number.
WILD MAGIC SORCERY SUBCLASS
ARTIST: WISNU TAN

-- 59 of 97 --

Level 18: Tamed Surge
Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on
that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Wild Magic Surge
1d100 	Effect
01–04 	Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
05–08
A creature that is Friendly toward you appears in a random unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The creature is under the DM’s control and
disappears 1 minute later. Roll 1d4 to determine the creature: on a 1, a Modron Duodrone appears; on a 2, a Flumph appears; on a 3, a Modron
Monodrone appears; on a 4, a Unicorn appears. See the
Monster Manual for the creature’s stat block.
09–12 	For the next minute, you regain 5 Hit Points at the start of each of your turns.
13–16 	Creatures have Disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.
17–20
You are subjected to an effect that lasts for 1 minute unless its description says otherwise. Roll 1d8 to determine the effect: on a 1, you’re surrounded
by faint, ethereal music only you and creatures within 5 feet of you can hear; on a 2, your size increases by one size category; on a 3, you grow a long
beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode from your face and vanish; on a 4, you must shout when
you speak; on a 5, illusory butterflies flutter in the air within 10 feet of you; on a 6, an eye appears on your forehead, granting you Advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks; on an 7, pink bubbles float out of your mouth whenever you speak; on an 8, your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue for
24 hours or until the effect is ended by a
Remove Curse spell.
21–24 	For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of an action have a casting time of a Bonus Action.
25–28 You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn. You then return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest
unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
THE SORCERER DELINA MANIPULATES WILD MAGIC TO CREATE UNPREDICTABLE WONDERS

-- 60 of 97 --

1d100 	Effect
29–32 The next time you cast a spell that deals damage within the next minute, don’t roll the spell’s damage dice for the damage. Instead use the highest
number possible for each damage die.
33–36 	You have Resistance to all damage for the next minute.
37–40 You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While you’re a plant, you have the Incapacitated condition and have Vulnerability to all
damage. If you drop to 0 Hit Points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.
41–44 	For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a Bonus Action on each of your turns.
45–48 You and up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you have the Invisible condition for 1 minute. This invisibility ends on a creature
immediately after it makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell.
49–52 	A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to
Magic Missile.
53–56 	You can take one extra action on this turn.
57–60
You cast a random spell. If the spell normally requires Concentration, it doesn’t require Concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1,
Confusion; on a 2,
Fireball; on a 3,
Fog Cloud; on a 4,
Fly (cast on a random creature within 60 feet of you), on
a 5,
Grease; on a 6,
Levitate (cast on yourself); on a 7,
Magic Missile (cast as a level 5 spell); on an 8,
Mirror Image; on a 9,
Polymorph (cast on
yourself), and if you fail the saving throw, you turn into a Goat (see appendix B); on a 10,
See Invisibility.

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of
forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can
be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey,
demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some
serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.
Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power
and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one
invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options” section later in this class’s description.
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+
Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.
Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify.
You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.
Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice.
Eldritch Blast and
Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can
replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.
Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of
those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell
Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you
cast it as a level 3 spell.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock
spells.
Charm Person and
Hex are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be
of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell,
which can be of levels 1–3.
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

-- 64 of 97 --

Level 2: Magical Cunning
You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your
maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock
levels 8, 12, and 16.
Level 9: Contact Patron
In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the
Contact Other Plane spell
prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s
saving throw.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.
As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level
7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Eldritch Master
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.
Eldritch Invocation Options
Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order.

with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond
ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

-- 68 of 97 --

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity;
and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Book of Shadows (you determine its
appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this
feature or if you die.

Repelling Blast

Warlock Subclasses
A Warlock subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Archfey
Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses.
Archfey Patron
Bargain with Whimsical Fey
Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the
Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a
web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

Level 3: Archfey Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you
reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Steps of the Fey
Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You
can cast
Misty Step without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a Long Rest.
In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following
additional effects.
Refreshing Step. Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within
10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.
Taunting Step. Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have Disadvantage on attack rolls
against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.
Level 6: Misty Escape
You can cast
Misty Step as a Reaction in response to taking damage.
In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.
Disappearing Step. You have the Invisible condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast
a spell.
Dreadful Step. Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your
spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.
Level 10: Beguiling Defenses
Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the Charmed condition.
In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round
down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage
equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no
action required) to restore your use of it.
Level 14: Bewitching Magic
ARCHFEY PATRON SUBCLASS

-- 74 of 97 --

Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and
a spell slot, you can cast
Misty Step as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
Celestial Patron
Call on the Power of the Heavens
Your pact draws on the Upper Planes, the realms of everlasting bliss. You might enter
an agreement with an empyrean, a couatl, a sphinx, a unicorn, or another heavenly
entity. Or you might call on numerous such beings as you pursue goals aligned with
theirs. Your pact allows you to experience a hint of the holy light that illuminates the
multiverse.
Level 3: Celestial Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you
reach a Warlock level specified in the Celestial Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Healing Light
You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s
to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 plus your Warlock level.
As a Bonus Action, you can heal yourself or one creature you can see within 60 feet of
yourself, expending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can expend
at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you expend,
and restore a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total. Your pool regains all
expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Radiant Soul
Your link to your patron allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have Resistance to Radiant damage. Once per turn, when a spell you cast
deals Radiant or Fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage against one of the spell’s targets.
Level 10: Celestial Resilience
You gain Temporary Hit Points whenever you use your Magical Cunning feature or finish a Short or Long Rest. These Temporary Hit Points equal your
Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see when you gain the points. Those creatures each gain
Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.
Level 14: Searing Vengeance
CELESTIAL PATRON SUBCLASS
ARTIST: EKATERINA BURMAK

-- 75 of 97 --

When you or an ally within 60 feet of you is about to make a Death Saving Throw, you can unleash radiant energy to save the creature. The creature
regains Hit Points equal to half its Hit Point maximum and can end the Prone condition on itself. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of the
creature takes Radiant damage equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier, and each has the Blinded condition until the end of the current turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
Fiend Patron
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil
such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all
things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.
Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing
When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to
your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point).
You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0
Hit Points.
Level 3: Fiend Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you
reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the
listed spells prepared.

Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck
You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an
ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You
can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses
when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Fiendish Resilience
Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a
different one with this feature.
Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
FIEND PATRON SUBCLASS
ARTIST: JODIE MUIR

-- 76 of 97 --

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on
a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic
damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the Incapacitated condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the
nearest unoccupied space.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your
use of it.
Great Old One Patron
Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings
When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being from
the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God; Zargon,
the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might invoke several
entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these beings are
incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence. But the
secrets you’ve learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange magic from it.
Level 3: Awakened Mind
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a
Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the
chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you
are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other
knows.
The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It
ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different creature.
Level 3: Great Old One Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you
reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always
have the listed spells prepared.

GREAT OLD ONE PATRON SUBCLASS
ARTIST: MAGALI VILLENEUVE

-- 77 of 97 --

When you cast a Warlock spell that deals damage, you can change its damage type to Psychic. In addition, when you cast a Warlock spell that is an
Enchantment or Illusion, you can do so without Verbal or Somatic components.
Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant
When you form a telepathic bond with a creature using your Awakened Mind, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature for
the duration of the bond.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to
restore your use of it.
Level 10: Eldritch Hex
Your alien patron grants you a powerful curse. You always have the
Hex spell prepared. When you cast
Hex and choose an ability, the target also has
Disadvantage on saving throws of the chosen ability for the duration of the spell.
Level 10: Thought Shield
Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have Resistance to Psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals
Psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you take.
Level 14: Create Thrall
When you cast
Summon Aberration, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that
casting, and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.
In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your
Hex, the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to the target equal
to the bonus damage of that spell.

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic’s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and
spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their
mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into
schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across
the multiverse.
The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military
forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.
But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost
cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those
secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

Level 1: Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those
rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice.
Light,
Mage Hand, and
Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can
replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.
Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100
pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting
Identify. You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a
collection of vellum bound with twine.
The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.
Detect Magic,
Feather Fall,
Mage Armor,
Magic
Missile,
Sleep, and
Thunderwave are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.
Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from
your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
combination, chosen from your spellbook.
If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells
from your spellbook.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

-- 81 of 97 --

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.
Level 1: Ritual Adept
You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read
from the book to cast a spell in this way.
Level 1: Arcane Recovery
You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The
spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if
you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 2: Scholar
While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History,
Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.
Level 3: Wizard Subclass
You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer, Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a
specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard
level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard
levels 8, 12, and 16.
ARTIST: APRIL PRIME

-- 82 of 97 --

Level 5: Memorize Spell
Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting
feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.
Level 18: Spell Mastery
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting
time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at
a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.
Level 20: Signature Spells
Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3
without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher
level, you must expend a spell slot.
Wizard Spell List

Wizard Subclasses
A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Abjurer,
Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses.
Abjurer
Shield Companions and Banish Foes
Your study of magic is focused on spells that block, banish, or protect—ending harmful effects, banishing evil influences, and protecting the weak. Abjurers
are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence

-- 91 of 97 --

must be closed. Adventuring parties value Abjurers for the protection they provide against a variety of hostile magic and other attacks.
Level 3: Abjuration Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuration school, each of which must be no
higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class,
you can add one Wizard spell from the Abjuration school to your spellbook for
free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Arcane Ward
You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an
Abjuration spell with a spell slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the
spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a
Long Rest. The ward has a Hit Point maximum equal to twice your Wizard level
plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the
damage instead, and if you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them
before reducing the ward’s Hit Points. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit
Points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 Hit Points, it can’t
absorb damage, but its magic remains.
Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains a
number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot. Alternatively, as a
Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot, and the ward regains a number of Hit
Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.
Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Projected Ward
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage, you can take a Reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If
this damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. If that creature has any Resistances or Vulnerabilities,
apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points.
Level 10: Spell Breaker
You always have the
Counterspell and
Dispel Magic spells prepared. In addition, you can cast
Dispel Magic as a Bonus Action, and you can add your
Proficiency Bonus to its ability check.
When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended if the spell fails to stop a spell.
Level 14: Spell Resistance
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells, and you have Resistance to the damage of spells.
Diviner
Learn the Secrets of the Multiverse
ABJURER SUBCLASS
ARTIST: CAROLINE GARIBA

-- 92 of 97 --

The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who want a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of
space, time, and consciousness. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.
Level 3: Divination Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Divination school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Divination school to your spellbook
for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Portent
Glimpses of the future begin to press on your awareness. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace
any D20 Test made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a
roll in this way only once per turn.
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
Level 6: Expert Divination
Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level
2+ spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the slot you expended and can’t be higher than level 5.
Level 10: The Third Eye
You can increase your powers of perception. As a Bonus Action, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a Short or Long Rest. You
can’t use this feature again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Darkvision. You gain Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.
Greater Comprehension. You can read any language.
DIVINER SUBCLASS
ARTIST: JODIE MUIR

-- 93 of 97 --

See Invisibility. You can cast
See Invisibility without expending a spell slot.
Level 14: Greater Portent
The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature rather than
two.
Evoker
Create Explosive Elemental Effects
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.
Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek
their own gain.
Level 3: Evocation Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
EVOKER SUBCLASS
ARTIST: CAROLINE GARIBA

-- 94 of 97 --

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook
for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Potent Cantrip
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or
the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the
cantrip.
Level 6: Sculpt Spells
You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the
spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
Level 10: Empowered Evocation
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Overchannel
You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.
Illusionist
Weave Subtle Spells of Deception
You specialize in magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind, and the illusions you craft make the impossible seem real.
ARTIST: POLAR ENGINE

-- 95 of 97 --

Level 3: Illusion Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Illusion school to your spellbook for
free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Improved Illusions
You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal components, and if an Illusion spell you cast has a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet.
You also know the
Minor Illusion cantrip. If you already know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your
number of cantrips known. You can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of
Minor Illusion, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.
Level 6: Phantasmal Creatures
You always have the
Summon Beast and
Summon Fey spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you can change its school to Illusion, which causes
the summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast the Illusion version of each spell without expending a spell slot, but casting it without a slot halves
the creature’s Hit Points. Once you cast either spell without a spell slot, you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast the spell in that way again.

Level 10: Illusory Self
When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to interpose an illusory duplicate of yourself between the attacker and yourself. The
attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot
(no action required).
Level 14: Illusory Reality
You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose
one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is
ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can’t deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge
over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.
