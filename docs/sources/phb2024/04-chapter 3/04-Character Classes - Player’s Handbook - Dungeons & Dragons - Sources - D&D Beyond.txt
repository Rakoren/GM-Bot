Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to
anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil.
Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an
impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess,
but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.
Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to.
Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

Level 1: Rage
You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if
you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.
You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended
use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
While active, your Rage follows the rules below.
Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
Rage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to
the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.
Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.
Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still
active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:
Make an attack roll against an enemy.
Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.
Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain
this benefit.
ARTIST: WAYNE ENGLAND

-- 7 of 87 --

Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes
and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Level 2: Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving
throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
Level 2: Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack
recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during
that time.
Level 3: Barbarian Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart, Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses
are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you
gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.
Level 3: Primal Knowledge
You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the
following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.
When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian
levels 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Fast Movement

-- 8 of 87 --

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.
Level 7: Feral Instinct
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.
Level 7: Instinctive Pounce
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.
Level 9: Brutal Strike
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have
Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking
Opportunity Attacks.
Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—
the most recent one.
Level 11: Relentless Rage
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.
Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.
Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.
Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack
roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.
Level 15: Persistent Rage
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long
Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.
Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike
feature.
Level 18: Indomitable Might
If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.
Level 20: Primal Champion
You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.
Barbarian Subclasses

-- 9 of 87 --

A Barbarian subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Path of
the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart, Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses.
Path of the Berserker
Channel Rage into Violent Fury
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos
of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.
Level 3: Frenzy
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To
determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the
weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.
PATH OF THE BERSERKER SUBCLASS
ARTIST: NATHANIEL HIMAWAN

-- 10 of 87 --

Level 6: Mindless Rage
You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the
condition ends on you.
Level 10: Retaliation
When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a
weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Level 14: Intimidating Presence
As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-
foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a
creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use
of it.
Path of the Wild Heart
Walk in Community with the Animal World
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart view themselves as kin to animals. These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals,
and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might.
ARTIST: ALDITHA SIREGAR

-- 11 of 87 --

Level 3: Animal Speaker
You can cast the
Beast Sense and
Speak with Animals spells but only as Rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.
Level 3: Rage of the Wilds
Your Rage taps into the primal power of animals. Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice.
Bear. While your Rage is active, you have Resistance to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.
Eagle. When you activate your Rage, you can take the Disengage and Dash actions as part of that Bonus Action. While your Rage is active, you can take a
Bonus Action to take both of those actions.
Wolf. While your Rage is active, your allies have Advantage on attack rolls against any enemy of yours within 5 feet of you.
Level 6: Aspect of the Wilds
You gain one of the following options of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your choice.
Owl. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.
Panther. You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
PATH OF THE WILD HEART SUBCLASS

-- 12 of 87 --

Salmon. You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
Level 10: Nature Speaker

Commune with Nature spell but only as a Ritual. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

Falcon. While your Rage is active, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed if you aren’t wearing any armor.
Lion. While your Rage is active, any of your enemies within 5 feet of you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another
Barbarian who has this option active.
Ram. While your Rage is active, you can cause a Large or smaller creature to have the Prone condition when you hit it with a melee attack.
Path of the World Tree
Trace the Roots and Branches of the Multiverse
Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their Rage. This tree grows among the Outer Planes,
connecting them to each other and the Material Plane. These Barbarians draw on the tree’s magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.
Level 3: Vitality of the Tree
PATH OF THE WORLD TREE SUBCLASS
ARTIST: MARCELA MEDEIROS

-- 13 of 87 --

Your Rage taps into the life force of the World Tree. You gain the following benefits.
Vitality Surge. When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Barbarian level.
Life-Giving Force. At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain Temporary
Hit Points. To determine the number of Temporary Hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of
these Temporary Hit Points remain when your Rage ends, they vanish.
Level 6: Branches of the Tree
Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to summon spectral branches of the
World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be teleported to an
unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed
to 0 until the end of the current turn.
Level 10: Battering Roots
During your turn, your reach is 10 feet greater with any Melee weapon that has the Heavy or Versatile property, as tendrils of the World Tree extend from
you. When you hit with such a weapon on your turn, you can activate the Push or Topple mastery property in addition to a different mastery property you’re
using with that weapon.
Level 14: Travel along the Tree
When you activate your Rage and as a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
In addition, once per Rage, you can increase the range of that teleport to 150 feet. When you do so, you can also bring up to six willing creatures who are
within 10 feet of you. Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of your destination space.
Path of the Zealot
Rage in Ecstatic Union with a God
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot receive boons from a god or pantheon. These Barbarians experience their Rage as an ecstatic episode of divine
union that infuses them with power. They are often allies to the priests and other followers of their god or pantheon.
ARTIST: IGNATIUS BUDI

-- 14 of 87 --

Level 3: Divine Fury
You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose the type each
time you deal the damage.
Level 3: Warrior of the Gods
A divine entity helps ensure you can continue the fight. You have a pool of four d12s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can
expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total.
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.
The pool’s maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).
Level 6: Fanatical Focus
Once per active Rage, if you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and you must use the new roll.
Level 10: Zealous Presence
As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain Advantage on
attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

of it.
PATH OF THE ZEALOT SUBCLASS

-- 15 of 87 --

Level 14: Rage of the Gods

While in this form, you gain the benefits below.
Flight. You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.
Resistance. You have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage.

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards
believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic
magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.
Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music,
working magic, and making jests.
A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of
knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

Level 1: Bardic Inspiration
You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.
Using Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of
your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20,
potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.
Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

-- 18 of 87 --

At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table.
The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules
with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list.
Dancing Lights and
Vicious Mockery are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.
When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells
from the Bard spell list.
Charm Person,
Color Spray,
Dissonant Whispers, and
Healing Word are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
Level 2: Expertise
You gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have
proficiency in them.
At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.
Level 2: Jack of All Trades
You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use
your Proficiency Bonus.
For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

Level 3: Bard Subclass
You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Dance, College of Glamour, College of Lore, and College of Valor subclasses are detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels
8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Font of Inspiration
You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.
Level 7: Countercharm
You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an
effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

ARTIST: YUHONG DING

-- 20 of 87 --

Level 10: Magical Secrets
You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard
Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as
Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell
from those lists.
Level 18: Superior Inspiration
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.
Level 20: Words of Creation
You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the
Power Word Heal and
Power Word Kill spells
prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

Bard Subclasses
A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass. Bards form loose associations, which they
call colleges, to preserve their traditions. This section presents the College of Dance, College of Glamour, College of Lore, and College of Valor subclasses.
College of Dance
ARTIST: KATERINA LADON

-- 26 of 87 --

Move in Harmony with the Cosmos
Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can’t be contained within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of
celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that
emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.
Level 3: Dazzling Footwork
While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits.
Dance Virtuoso. You have Advantage on any Charisma (Performance) check you make that involves you dancing.
Unarmored Defense. Your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.
Agile Strikes. When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one Unarmed Strike as
part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.
Bardic Damage. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your Unarmed Strikes. When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike,
you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike’s normal damage. This roll
doesn’t expend the die.
Level 6: Inspiring Movement
When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half
your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using their Reaction.
None of this feature’s movement provokes Opportunity Attacks.
Level 6: Tandem Footwork
When you roll Initiative, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic
Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to Initiative equal to the number rolled.
Level 14: Leading Evasion
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can
share this benefit with them for that save.
You can’t use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.
College of Glamour
Weave Beguiling Fey Magic
The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their
songs and stories, and the mightiest among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten
innocence, evoke unconscious memories of long-held fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.
COLLEGE OF DANCE SUBCLASS
ARTIST: HOCHEOL RYU

-- 27 of 87 --

Level 3: Beguiling Magic
You always have the
Charm Person and
Mirror Image spells prepared.
In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to
make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed or Frightened condition (your choice) for 1 minute.
The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic
Inspiration (no action required).
Level 3: Mantle of Inspiration
You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic
Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and
then each can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
Level 6: Mantle of Majesty
You always have the
Command spell prepared.
As a Bonus Action, you cast
Command without expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or until your Concentration
ends. During this time, you can cast
Command as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot.
COLLEGE OF GLAMOUR SUBCLASS

-- 28 of 87 --

Any creature Charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the
Command you cast with this feature.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell slot (no action
required).
Level 14: Unbreakable Majesty
As a Bonus Action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. For the duration, whenever
any creature hits you with an attack roll for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the
attack misses instead, as the creature recoils from your majesty.
Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
College of Lore
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge
COLLEGE OF LORE SUBCLASS
ARTIST: MIKE PAPE

-- 29 of 87 --

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s
members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose
corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.
Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
Level 3: Cutting Words
You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see
within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic
Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success
into a failure.
Level 6: Magical Discoveries
You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or any combination thereof (see a class’s section for
its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Bard Features table.
You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these
requirements.
Level 14: Peerless Skill
When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number
rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.
College of Valor
Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes
ARTIST: IGNATIUS BUDI

-- 30 of 87 --

Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the
mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these
events doesn’t pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
Level 3: Combat Inspiration
You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.
Defense. When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC
against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.
Offense. Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the
attack’s damage against the target.
Level 3: Martial Training
You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.
In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.
Level 6: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
COLLEGE OF VALOR SUBCLASS

-- 31 of 87 --

In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.
Level 14: Battle Magic
After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can
reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.
Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their
magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer
Planes.
Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and
rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list.
Guidance,
Sacred Flame, and
Thaumaturgy are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.
When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells
from the Cleric spell list.
Bless,
Cure Wounds,
Guiding Bolt, and
Shield of Faith are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen

-- 34 of 87 --

spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other
Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.
Level 1: Divine Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.
Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.
Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your
Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
Level 2: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each
of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain
additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll
1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage (round down).
You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).
Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to
move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you
die.
Level 3: Cleric Subclass
You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class’s
description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s
features that are of your Cleric level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels
8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Sear Undead
Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead
that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.
Level 7: Blessed Strikes

-- 35 of 87 --

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use
only the option you choose for this feature).
Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic
or Radiant damage (your choice).
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.
Level 10: Divine Intervention
You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a
Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature
again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes
The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.
Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet
of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention
You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose
Wish when you select a spell. If you
do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.

Cleric Subclasses
A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a
domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War
Domain subclasses.
Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the
multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life
force to cure many hurts.
Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of
almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated
with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and
community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.
Level 3: Disciple of Life
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature
regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points
equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level.
Level 3: Life Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready.
When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter
always have the listed spells prepared.
Life Domain Spells
Cleric Level 	Prepared Spells

Aid,
Bless,
Cure Wounds,
Lesser Restoration
5	
Mass Healing Word,
Revivify
7	
Aura of Life,

9	
Greater Restoration,
Mass Cure Wounds
Level 3: Preserve Life
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.
Level 6: Blessed Healer
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures
other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.
Level 17: Supreme Healing
LIFE DOMAIN SUBCLASS
ARTIST: TOMAS DUCHEK

-- 41 of 87 --

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing;
instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.
Light Domain
Bring Light to Banish Darkness
The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with
radiance and the power of their deities’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.
The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and
renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the
sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of
beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement.
Level 3: Light Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready.
When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Light Domain Spells table, you thereafter
always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Radiance of the Dawn
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel
Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot Emanation originating from yourself. Any
magical Darkness—such as that created by the
Darkness spell—in that area is
dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area must make a
Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 plus your Cleric level
on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Level 3: Warding Flare
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to impose Disadvantage on the attack roll,
causing light to flare before it hits or misses.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Improved Warding Flare
You regain all expended uses of your Warding Flare when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
LIGHT DOMAIN SUBCLASS
ARTIST: JODIE MUIR

-- 42 of 87 --

In addition, whenever you use Warding Flare, you can give the target of the triggering attack a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 2d6 plus your
Wisdom modifier.
Level 17: Corona of Light
As a Magic action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit Bright Light in
a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the Bright Light have Disadvantage on saving throws against your Radiance of
the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
Trickery Domain
Make Mischief and Challenge Authority
The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride,
mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation.
Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant
challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the
forces of change and social upheaval, and they’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels,
gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially
those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw
on the power of the Trickery Domain.
Level 3: Blessing of the Trickster
As a Magic action, you can choose yourself or a willing creature within 30 feet of
yourself to have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts
until you finish a Long Rest or you use this feature again.
Level 3: Trickery Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells
ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Trickery Domain Spells table,
you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Invoke Duplicity
As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see
within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required)
TRICKERY DOMAIN SUBCLASS
ARTIST: POLAR ENGINE

-- 43 of 87 --

or have the Incapacitated condition. The illusion is animated and mimics your expressions and gestures. While it persists, you gain the following benefits.
Cast Spells. You can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses.
Distract. When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature,
given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
Move. As a Bonus Action, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is within 120 feet of yourself.
Level 6: Trickster’s Transposition
Whenever you take the Bonus Action to create or move the illusion of your Invoke Duplicity, you can teleport, swapping places with the illusion.
Level 17: Improved Duplicity
The illusion of your Invoke Duplicity has grown more powerful in the following ways.
Shared Distraction. When you and your allies make attack rolls against a creature within 5 feet of the illusion, the attack rolls have Advantage.
Healing Illusion. When the illusion ends, you or a creature of your choice within 5 feet of it regains a number of Hit Points equal to your Cleric level.
War Domain
Inspire Valor and Smite Foes
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing
instances of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering
acts of violence as prayers.
Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds.
They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and
pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its
manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.
Level 3: Guided Strike
When you or a creature within 30 feet of you misses with an attack roll, you can expend
one use of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus, potentially causing it
to hit. When you use this feature to benefit another creature’s attack roll, you must take
a Reaction to do so.
Level 3: War Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready.
When you reach a Cleric level specified in the War Domain Spells table, you thereafter
always have the listed spells prepared.

As a Bonus Action, you can make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Level 6: War God’s Blessing
You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast
Shield of Faith or
Spiritual Weapon rather than expending a spell slot. When you cast either spell in
this way, the spell doesn’t require Concentration. Instead the spell lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you cast that spell again, have the Incapacitated
condition, or die.
Level 17: Avatar of Battle
You gain Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform
into animals, and wield elemental destruction.
Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites
that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.
Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature.
Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as
adventurers who combat the threat.

Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details
how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list.
Druidcraft and
Produce Flame are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.
When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells
from the Druid spell list.
Animal Friendship,
Cure Wounds,
Faerie Fire, and
Thunderwave are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

-- 48 of 87 --

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid
spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.
Level 1: Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you
always have the
Speak with Animals spell prepared.
You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence
with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic.
Level 1: Primal Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.
Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence
(Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.
Level 2: Wild Shape
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this
feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the
Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.
Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.
Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that
lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you
can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.
When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast
Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
When choosing known forms, you may look in the
Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.
Beast Shapes
Druid Level 	Known Forms 	Max CR 	Fly Speed
2 	4 	1/4 	No
4 	6 	1/2 	No
8 	8 	1 	Yes
Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:
Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.
Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency

-- 49 of 87 --

Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use
the one in the stat block.
No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your
space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear
a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that
the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.
Level 2: Wild Companion
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the
Find Familiar spell without Material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Druid Subclass
You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars subclasses are detailed after
this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels
8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Wild Resurgence
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).
In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long
Rest.
Level 7: Elemental Fury
The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.
Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause
the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).
Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury
The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.
Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.
Level 18: Beast Spells
While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its
Material component.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.
Level 20: Archdruid
The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

-- 50 of 87 --

Evergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.
Nature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and
convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4
spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Longevity. The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

Druid Subclasses
A Druid subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels, as specified in the subclass. Druids form loose associations, which they
call circles. This section presents the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars subclasses.
Circle of the Land
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World
The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or
standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.
ARTIST: POLAR ENGINE

-- 56 of 87 --

Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or
tropical. Consult the table below that corresponds to the chosen type; you have the

Level 3: Land’s Aid
CIRCLE OF THE LAND SUBCLASS

-- 57 of 87 --

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns
appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).
Level 6: Natural Recovery
You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long
Rest before you do so again.
In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less
than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Nature’s Ward
You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature,
as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.
Nature’s Ward
Land Type 	Resistance
Arid 	Fire
Polar 	Cold
Temperate 	Lightning
Tropical 	Poison
Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet
of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and
your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.
Circle of the Moon
Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds
Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.
ARTIST: JOHN GRELLO

-- 58 of 87 --

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night,
soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through undergrowth as
a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid’s blood.
Level 3: Circle Forms
You can channel lunar magic when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the
benefits below.
Challenge Rating. The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level
divided by 3 (round down).
Armor Class. Until you leave the form, your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier if
that total is higher than the Beast’s AC.
Temporary Hit Points. You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to three times
your Druid level.
Level 3: Circle of the Moon Spells
When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Moon Spells table, you
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
In addition, you can cast the spells from this feature while you’re in a Wild Shape form.

Level 6: Improved Circle Forms
While in a Wild Shape form, you gain the following benefits.
Lunar Radiance. Each of your attacks in a Wild Shape form can deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage. You make this choice each time you hit
with those attacks.
Increased Toughness. You can add your Wisdom modifier to your Constitution saving throws.
CIRCLE OF THE MOON SUBCLASS
ARTIST: JOHN GRELLO

-- 59 of 87 --

Level 10: Moonlight Step
You magically transport yourself, reappearing amid a burst of moonlight. As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see,
and you have Advantage on the next attack roll you make before the end of this turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest. You can also regain uses by expending a level 2+ spell slot for each use you want to restore (no action required).
Level 14: Lunar Form
The power of the moon suffuses you, granting you the following benefits.
Improved Lunar Radiance. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d10 Radiant damage to a target you hit with a Wild Shape form’s attack.
Shared Moonlight. Whenever you use Moonlight Step, you can also teleport one willing creature. That creature must be within 10 feet of you, and you
teleport it to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of your destination space.
Circle of the Sea
Become One with Tides and Storms
Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature’s wrath, seeking
vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the
rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.
A DRUID IN WOLF FORM HOWLS AT THE MOON
ARTIST: RICCARDO MOSCATELLO

-- 60 of 87 --

Level 3: Circle of the Sea Spells
When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Wrath of the Sea
As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot
Emanation that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes.
It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the
Incapacitated condition.
When you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent
turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take
Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet
away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your
Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).
Level 6: Aquatic Affinity
The size of the Emanation created by your Wrath of the Sea increases to 10 feet.
In addition, you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
Level 10: Stormborn
Your Wrath of the Sea confers two more benefits while active, as detailed below.
Flight. You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.
Resistance. You have Resistance to Cold, Lightning, and Thunder damage.
Level 14: Oceanic Gift
Instead of manifesting the Emanation of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That
creature gains all the benefits of the Emanation and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.
In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when
manifesting it.
Circle of the Stars
CIRCLE OF THE SEA SUBCLASS
ARTIST: MARCELA MEDEIROS

-- 61 of 87 --

Harness Secrets Hidden in Constellations
The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial,
discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the
Druids of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos.
Level 3: Star Map
You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you
can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine its form by
rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.
While holding the map, you have the
Guidance and
Guiding Bolt spells prepared, and
you can cast
Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a
number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a
replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it
destroys the previous map.
Star Map
1d6 	Map Form
1 	A scroll bearing depictions of constellations
2 	A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it
3 	An owlbear hide tooled with stellar symbols
4 	A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover
5 	A crystal engraved with starry patterns
6 	A glass disk etched with constellations
Level 3: Starry Form
As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.
While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them
as on a star chart. This form sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if
you dismiss it (no action required), have the Incapacitated condition, or use this feature again.
Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while
in the form.
Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can
make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal
to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.
Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or
another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.
Dragon. A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain
Concentration, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.
CIRCLE OF THE STARS SUBCLASS

-- 62 of 87 --

Level 6: Cosmic Omen
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special
Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:
Weal (Even). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number
rolled to the total.
Woe (Odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the
number rolled from the total.
You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
Level 10: Twinkling Constellations
The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed
of 20 feet and can hover.
Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.
Level 14: Full of Stars
While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled
prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.
Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is
adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive
specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.
Becoming a Fighter...

20 	+6 	Three Extra Attacks 	4 	6
Level 1: Fighting Style
You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Defense is recommended.
Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.
Level 1: Second Wind
You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus
your Fighter level.
You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a
Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
column of the Fighter Features table.
Level 2: Action Surge
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once
on a turn.
Level 2: Tactical Mind
You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward
success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still
fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.
Level 3: Fighter Subclass
You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Battle Master, Champion, Eldritch Knight, and Psi Warrior subclasses are detailed after this class’s
description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s
features that are of your Fighter level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter
levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Tactical Shift

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table.
Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table.
The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five

fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item to which someone else is attuned.
Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have the Incapacitated condition. If it is on the same plane
of existence, you can summon that weapon as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

telekinetic energy, and create barriers of mental force.
Level 3: Psionic Power
You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your
Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. The Psi Warrior

5 	D8 	6
9 	D8 	8
11 	D10 	8
13 	D10 	10
17 	D12 	12

subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a
power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all
your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.
You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest,
and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.
Telekinetic Movement. You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As a Magic action, choose one target you can see within 30 feet of yourself;
the target must be a loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature other than you. You transport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
space you can see. Alternatively, if the target is a Tiny object, you can transport it to or from your hand.
Once you take this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore
your use of it.

of it.
Level 18: Telekinetic Master

Telekinesis spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is
Intelligence. On each of your turns while you maintain Concentration on it, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a
Bonus Action.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action

Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different
Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of
martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.
Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or
without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.
Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other
Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.
Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than
merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.
Level 2: Monk’s Focus
Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of
the Wind, each of which is detailed below.
When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Level 3: Deflect Attacks
When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total
damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet
of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged
attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The

them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target
must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
