In such charnel environs, they feast on the dead with no qualms\nabout their meals’ origins or freshness.\nCarrion crawlers have segmented bodies like gigantic cutworms. From beneath their multipart maws protrude eight thin, lashing tentacles. Creatures struck\nby these tentacles risk being paralyzed and consumed.\nCarrion crawlers scour sewers, battlefields, necropolises, and fetid wildernesses for corpses, clinging to ceilings to ambush smaller prey and to avoid\ncompeting hunters. They’re drawn to light and the scent of blood, recognizing them as signs of food.\nThese scavengers avoid ingesting inorganic material. Crypts with funeral armors sucked clean of their corpses and eerily pristine catacombs are signs of\ninfestation by carrion crawlers.\nCentaurs\nDefenders of the Feywild\nHabitat: Forest, Grassland, Planar (Feywild); Treasure: Armaments, Individual\nCentaurs are defenders of forests, plains, and sites of primeval power.
