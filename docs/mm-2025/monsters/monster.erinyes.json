These vicious predators have arachnid features and\nhunched, bipedal frames, and they’re notorious for their venomous bites and ability to shoot out webs to entrap their victims. Ettercaps often hunt in small\ngroups alongside giant spiders and mundane spider swarms.\nEttercaps frequently overhunt their environment. Left unchecked, ettercaps might fill whole woodlands with their webs and the cocooned remains of past\nmeals, which puts ettercaps in conflict with Fey. Spiteful ettercaps go out of their way to torment and feed on Fey; they prefer to menace those smaller than\nthemselves, like pixies and sprites. They rarely devour other sapient creatures swiftly, preferring to cocoon their captives and terrorize them for days.\nEttercaps avoid fire, which can quickly burn through their webs and the dead trees where they make their homes.\nEttin\nQuarrelsome Two-Headed Giant\nHabitat: Hill, Mountain, Underdark; Treasure: Individual",
