These fallen angels exact a merciless form of divine justice, hunting down oath\nbreakers and dragging the rightfully damned to the Nine Hells in the grip of their magical ropes. Few ever glimpse what lies within these devils’ armored\nexteriors, and erinyes ensure that those who do can never speak of what they’ve seen.\nErinyes often serve archdevils and guard the order of the Nine Hells against trespassers and escapees. Although they’re prone to wrathful outbursts, erinyes\ncooperate well with other devils. They sometimes hunt in trios with other erinyes, forging infamous reputations for themselves.\nWhen not in the service of a diabolical master, erinyes hunt wicked souls. They pursue quarries relentlessly, across the multiverse and for ages if need be.\nWhile they might be summoned to serve evil magic-users, erinyes also listen for oaths and curses sworn in their names. In rare cases, wronged mortals who\ncall out with just rage might be heard by an erinyes who appears to take vengeance on their behalf. Once erinyes are so summoned, they won’t leave\nwithout claiming the soul of either their quarry or the mortal who summoned them.\nDivine Ray.
