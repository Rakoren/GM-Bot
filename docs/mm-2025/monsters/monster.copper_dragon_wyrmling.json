Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 6 miles of the lair.\nGiggle Fits. Whenever a creature other than the dragon and its allies is within 1 mile of the lair and rolls a 1 on a D20 Test, it must succeed on a DC 15\nWisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, as it is wracked with laughter.\nIf the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.\nAdult Copper Dragon\nCOPPER DRAGON WYRMLING",
