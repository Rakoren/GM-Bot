Within their alien sanctuaries, these\nwicked masterminds—also known as illithids—reshape the Underdark and its inhabitants to\nserve their unfathomable whims. Mind flayers are feared for their psionic powers, which allow\nthem to stun and control other creatures, and for their horrific method of feeding: using their\nfour slimy tentacles to extract the brains of their victims.\nMind flayers are infamous plotters and manipulators, concocting plans that reach beyond\ntheir subterranean realms. Aside from using their psionic powers to control others, mind\nflayers often experiment with their own bizarre life cycles, implanting other creatures with\nillithid young to create unnatural servants. Creatures such as grimlocks and intellect\ndevourers result from mind flayers’ biological tampering, while other Underdark-dwelling\nmonsters—including kuo-toa, quaggoths, and troglodytes—often serve illithid masters.\nGithyanki and githzerai have a long adversarial history with mind flayers and bear the scars\nof illithid manipulation.\nMind Flayer Colonies\nMind flayers work as lone schemers, in mysterious cabals, or as part of worlds-spanning illithid conspiracies. In groups, mind flayers work toward bizarre\nagendas organized by an elder brain—a massive, brain-like being with incredible psionic powers. Without such a leader, groups of mind flayers fall to self-\ndestructive squabbling. Roll on or choose a result from the Mind Flayer Machinations table to inspire an illithid conclave’s plots.\nMOD \tSAVE\nSTR \t17 \t+3 \t+3\nDEX \t12 \t+1 \t+1\nCON \t15 \t+2 \t+2\nMOD \tSAVE\nINT \t5 \t−3 \t−3\nWIS \t13 \t+1 \t+1\nCHA \t8 \t−1 \t−1\nSkills Stealth +5\nImmunities Acid; Prone\nSenses Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception 11\nLanguages None\nCR 2 (XP 450; PB +2)\nTraits\nAdhesive (Object Form Only).

Other mind flayers view those that undertake such experiments with disgust and fear.",
