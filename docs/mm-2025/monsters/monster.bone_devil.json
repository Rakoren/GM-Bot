Bone nagas are skeletal terrors raised from the remains of magically slain\nnagas or nagas that were killed but that hadn’t yet rejuvenated. They are granted unlife through rituals practiced by cultists, yuan-ti, and morbid spirit\nnagas. These Undead nagas possess magical abilities similar to those they had in life, along with an eerie gaze that can beguile other creatures.\nBone nagas typically obey those who resurrected them, serving their creators as tireless guards and sharing the lore they collected in life. Undeath disrupts\nthe perfect memory bone nagas enjoyed while alive, leaving them with gaps in their memories or details scrambled into puzzle-like jumbles.\nIn rare cases, bone nagas continue to pursue the goals they had while alive instead of serving other creatures.

Although these metallic dragons favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey\nconsiderable distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they’ve learned, and collect news. Though good natured, brass dragons don’t shirk from\ncombat when necessary, thwarting foes with magical sleep and searing them with flame.\nBrass dragons favor warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and they usually dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that\nregularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested\nin others’ stories.\nBrass dragons collect eclectic objects. While such items might seem like\nknickknacks, each is part of a story—perhaps a nostalgic memento or evidence of\na tale passed into myth. An old friend’s hat and the crown of the last ruler of a\nforgotten dynasty could occupy the same shelf in a brass dragon’s hoard.\nBrass Dragon Wyrmling\nBrass dragon wyrmlings are relentlessly curious. These dragons eagerly engage\napproachable creatures and are quick to explore any place that has an interesting\nstory. Once they hear tales of adventure, many are keen to start their own quests.",
