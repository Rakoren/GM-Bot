Charm Ray. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 13 (3d8) Psychic damage, and the target has the Charmed condition for 1 hour or until it takes damage. Success: Half damage only. 2. Paralyzing Ray. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: The target has the Paralyzed condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically. 3. Fear Ray. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 10 (3d6) Psychic damage, and the target has the Frightened condition until the end of its next turn. Success: Half damage only. 4. Slowing Ray. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 18 (4d8) Necrotic damage. Until the end of the target's next turn, the target can't take Reactions; its Speed is halved; and it can take either an action or a Bonus Action on its turn, not both. Success: Half damage only. 5. Enervation Ray. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 16 (3d10) Poison damage, and the target has the Poisoned condition until the end of its next turn. While Poisoned, the target can't regain Hit Points. Success: Half damage only. 6. Telekinetic Ray. Strength Saving Throw: DC 17 (the target succeeds automatically if it is Gargantuan). Failure: The death tyrant moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction. The target has the Restrained condition until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant has the Incapacitated condition. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a tool or opening a door or container. 7. Sleep Ray. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 17 (the target succeeds automatically if it is a Construct or an Undead). Failure: The target has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute. The condition ends if the target takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it. 8. Petrification Ray. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 17. First Failure: The target has the Restrained condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. Second Failure: The target has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition. 9. Disintegration Ray. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 36 (8d8) Force damage. If the target is a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force, a 10-foot Cube of it disintegrates into dust. Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: If the target is a creature and this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it disintegrates into dust. 10. Death Ray. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 55 (10d10) Necrotic damage. Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 Hit Points."
