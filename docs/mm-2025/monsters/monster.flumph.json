In their pride, they were tricked into invading the Feywild to claim\nits magic for their own. When the archfey rulers of that realm united, the fomorians were turned back and cursed with supernatural strangeness to make\ntheir bodies match their vile souls. Ever since, fomorians have dwelled in the Underdark amid the ruins of their magical cities. The archfey’s curse afflicts\nthem still, tormenting them with wandering cankers, lurching organs, and stranger discomforts. Rather than atoning for their offenses, fomorians harness\nthe magic of their curse and turn it against others. Roll on or choose a result from the Fomorian Warping table to inspire the cosmetic effects a creature\nundergoes while they’re affected by a fomorian’s Warping Hex.\nFomorian Warping\n1d4 \tThe Fomorian’s Hex Causes...\n1 \tColorful, wandering pustules.\n2 \tExcessive sweating of rainbow-hued fluids.\n3 \tPatches of wriggling hair.\n4 \tVeins that bulge and lurch under the skin.",
