  "raw_text": "AC 13 \tInitiative +2 (12)\tMedium Celestial or Fiend (Titan), Neutral\nEmpyrean\nInheritors of divine might, empyreans are idealized, human-shaped beings of godly power. These beings might have relationships with their creators akin to\nthose of parents and their children, royalty and their servants, inventors and their creations, or other bonds. Empyreans’ existences are fundamentally\ninfluenced by their patrons and their connection to the heavenly deities of the Upper Planes or the fiendish deities of the Lower Planes. Nevertheless,\nempyreans have free will.\nCelestial empyreans are typically noble beings who quest to prove themselves worthy of their divine pedigree. Many work in the service of their parents or\nsupport those gods’ causes and champions.\nFiendish empyreans are usually dreadful, self-serving villains who seek to claim their parents’ power. Some forge unholy armies or rule over hidden realms\nin mockery of true gods, while others might seek to escape their accursed families.\nHP 22 (5d8)\nSpeed 5 ft., Fly 30 ft.
