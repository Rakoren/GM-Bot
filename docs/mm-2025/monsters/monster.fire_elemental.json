If the\ntarget is a creature or a flammable object, it starts burning.\nLarge Elemental, Neutral\nMost fire giants dwell in volcanically active mountains or cavernous depths that house their fortress-forges. Evil fire giants tend to be martially minded, and\nthey craft mighty arms to conquer their neighbors and seize valuable resources. More temperate fire giants trade their works for what they need, and they\nmight share the ancient techniques of Giant artisans with other craftspeople. In either case, fire giants are prone to undertaking ambitious designs, and they\nrarely appreciate interruptions in their titanic workshops.\nFlameskull\nSkull Smoldering with Magical Obsession\nHabitat: Underdark; Treasure: Arcana\nFlameskulls are flying skulls that blaze with magical fire and the half-\nremembered arcana of dead spellcasters. They rise from the remains of dead\nmagic-users who were reanimated by sinister necromancers or whose magical\npursuits drive them beyond death. Flameskulls might serve as guardians for their\ncreators or pursue ambitions left unfulfilled in life. They lash out at foes with\ndestructive spells and bursts of fire, wielding magic without the need for most\ncomponents.\nFlameskulls take various forms, from skulls with humanlike features to ones with\nfearsome or bestial alterations. Their flames vary in color and grow more intense\nwhen they’re angry. Roll on or choose a result from the Flameskull Details table to\ninspire what makes a flameskull distinctive.\nFlameskull Details\n1d6 \tThe Flameskull Features...\n1 \tArcane diagrams etched into it.\n2 \tFlames like dramatic features, horns, or hair.\n3 \tFractured pieces that fly in unison.\n4 \tAn iron plate bolted over its mouth.\n5 \tLethal head trauma.",
