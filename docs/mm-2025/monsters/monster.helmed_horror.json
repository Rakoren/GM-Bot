In croaking, reeking throngs, these ogre-size brutes seek to crush and consume foes. Their oozing\nhides are manifestations of embodied evils. Every few moments, patches of their slimy skins erupt with grotesque transformations such as rows of\nmismatched fangs, fungal growths, or half-formed features. These unsettling manifestations emerge, then roil away.\nHezrous serve more powerful demons, such as nalfeshnees and mariliths. They take the abuse and intimidation of these deadlier demons and pass it on\nto droves of weaker dretches and manes. This predictable brutality makes hezrous useful links in the chaotic structure of a demonic horde.\nWhen on the Material Plane or otherwise left to their own devices, hezrous recklessly indulge in destructive, short-sighted rampages. Only magic and threats\nfrom more powerful masters can curb these demons’ outrages and compel hezrous to pursue greater plots. Powerful spellcasters often use sinister\ncoercions, spells like\nMagic Circle and\nPlanar Binding, or other magic to force hezrous to serve them. Roll on or choose a result from the Demonic\nUndertakings table to inspire how a magic-user might employ a hezrou or similar demon.\nDemonic Undertakings\n1d6 \tThe Demon Is Compelled To...\n1 \tBreak open a vault and steal what’s within.\n2 \tDefile a place using blasphemous symbols and demonic gore.\n3 \tFetch or otherwise provide materials for a profane ritual.\n4 \tGuard a site and slay anyone who comes near.\n5 \tHunt down a foe, destroying everything barring the demon’s path.\n6 \tIntimidate someone into following orders.\nHill Giant\nGiant of Crags and Valleys\nHabitat: Hill; Treasure: Armaments",
