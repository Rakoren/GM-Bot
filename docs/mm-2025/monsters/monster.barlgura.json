Rather than chasing prey, they use their supernatural gaze to\nturn creatures to stone and then consume these victims at their leisure. While basilisks are most comfortable in subterranean lairs, many are captured and\nkept by unscrupulous folk seeking guardians for their treasures.\nThe remains of Petrified creatures litter the area where a basilisk hunts. These might be mundane creatures or more unusual beings that had dire\nencounters with a basilisk. Roll on or choose a result from the Petrified Basilisk Victims table to inspire the statues that might appear in a basilisk’s hunting\ngrounds. There is a 50 percent chance that any of these statues are missing limbs or broken into pieces.\nPetrified Basilisk Victims\n1d8 \tA Basilisk Used Its Gaze to Petrify...\n1 \tAn adventurer with an ornate key hanging around their neck.\n2 \tAnimals like bats, bears, deer, or goats.\n3 \tA climber clinging to a stalactite.\n4 \tItself using a large mirror or shiny surface.\nBonus Actions\nLeap.

These cruel soldiers follow the orders of diabolical generals as they defend\ninfernal realms, invade Material Plane worlds, and clash against demons in planes-spanning conflicts.\nLeft to their own devices, bearded devils encourage mortals to act callously and abuse their power, inflating their egos and inspiring petty tyrannies. Villains\naligned with the Nine Hells call on bearded devils to serve as guardians, enforce their will, or fight in wicked armies.\nBearded devils’ eponymous beards consist of grotesque, tentacle-like growths. These squirming, barb-riddled beards carry poison capable of preventing\nmagical healing. Bearded devils are also known for their distinctive glaives, through which they channel hellish energy. Those struck by these unnatural\nweapons suffer infernal wounds that grow worse until stanched or magically healed.",
