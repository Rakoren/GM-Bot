They hang from cavern ceilings along routes frequented by denizens of the\nUnderdark. Piercers might lurk for months at a time, waiting for any creature of their approximate size to pass underneath. When potential meals move\nbelow, piercers release their grip and plummet, intent on impaling prey in a single strike. If they’re successful, piercers consume their meals and then slowly\nclimb to a new ambush position. If they miss or fail to slay their targets, piercers attempt to squirm away, but they’re easily dispatched by creatures aware\nof their presence.\nPiercers are the larval form of ropers. Young piercers seek to move as far from ropers as they can to avoid ropers’ undiscerning hunger. Many piercers\nmigrate vast distances through the Underdark, often to caverns or buried ruins near the surface.\nSome sages say you unknowingly occupy the same ethereally\ncoterminous point as a phase spider an average of four times\neach year.\n—Marcus Wands, doubtful authority\nRule 8: Never trust a stalactite.\n—X the Mystic’s\nRules of Dungeon Survival",
