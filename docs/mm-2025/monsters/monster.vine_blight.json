Imbued with bloodlust, these blights feed on the living. Evidence of their\npast meals is often tangled amid their branches and roots. Tree blights cooperate with other blights, but they attack other tree-shaped beings they\nencounter, such as awakened trees and treants.\nGulthias Blight\nAncient plants twisted by evil, Gulthias blights feed on blood and despoil the surrounding land, often giving rise to subservient blights. These cursed plants\ntake their name from the story of their creation; the first of their kind was a tree that grew from the stake piercing the heart of the vampire Gulthias.
