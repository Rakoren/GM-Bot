They seek to\ntransform their territories into empires, domains to be feared by nations.\nBlue dragons have sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and\nbadlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the\nabandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers.\nRegalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons’ hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring\none-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons’ influence.\nBlue Dragon Wyrmling\nBlue dragon wyrmlings often serve other powerful creatures, learning the ways of control and establishing fearful reputations among weaker creatures.\nMany wyrmlings initially serve loyally, but as their powers grow to match their ambitions, they eventually betray or abandon their associates. These\nwyrmlings tempt small groups of creatures into their service, rewarding them with modest treasures and promises of future power.\nTraits\nAstral Implosion.
