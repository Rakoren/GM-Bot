The hippogriff doesn’t provoke an Opportunity Attack when it flies out of\nan enemy’s reach.\nActions\nMultiattack. The hippogriff makes two Rend attacks.\nLarge Monstrosity, Unaligned\nHobgoblins\nConquerors of Every Horizon\nHabitat: Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Planar (Acheron), Underdark; Treasure: Armaments, Individual\nHobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such drives by bending the world to their whims. Lone hobgoblins claim woodland\nterritories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their\nexpansionist zeal.\nHobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with\ndragons, warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire\nland to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of existence beyond.\nMany hobgoblins serve the violent god Maglubiyet, whose hunger for conquest matches their own. Hobgoblin followers of Maglubiyet flourish in the Infinite\nBattlefield of Acheron, where they endlessly indulge their drive for domination. These war-obsessed hobgoblins employ elaborate tactics and strange\nweapons, which they sometimes unleash on worlds of the Material Plane.\nHobgoblin Warfare\nThe drive to subjugate and pillage is part of hobgoblins’ supernatural nature, though a few might repress their warlike tendencies or turn them to more\nuseful ends. Roll on or choose a result from the Hobgoblin Strategies table to inspire how a hobgoblin carries out its conquest.\nHobgoblin Strategies\n1d6 \tThe Hobgoblin Works To...\n1 \tBuild a vessel to carry hobgoblin armies to new conquests.\n2 \tCapture monsters and train them to fight.\n3 \tCollapse a region into the Underdark so riches can be sifted from the ruins.\nRend. Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft.\nHit: 7 (1d8 + 3) Slashing damage.\nA HOBGOBLIN WARLORD OVERSEES A HOBGOBLIN CAPTAIN AND HOBGOBLIN WARRIORS MARCHING TO WAR\n1d6 \tThe Hobgoblin Works To...\n4 \tConstruct a giant machine to strip resources.\n5 \tConvince devils, dragons, or hobgoblins from Acheron to invade an enemy land.\n6 \tHelp shortsighted merchants undermine a government or despoil the environment.\nHobgoblin Warrior\nHobgoblin warriors might hunt and raid alone or with trained mastiffs, worgs, goblin gangs, or other allies. They employ simple tactics and exploit every\nadvantage their allies provide. They willingly sacrifice companions in their pursuit of victory.\nHobgoblin Captain\nHobgoblin captains are battlefield tacticians. They lead their allies to victory by employing martial skill and rallying others with orders and threats.\nHobgoblin captains usually oversee hobgoblin battle groups or gangs of weaker monsters.\nHobgoblin Warlord\nHobgoblin warlords lead armies of hobgoblins and their allies, using their experience and strategic minds to command amid the ebb and flow of battle.",
