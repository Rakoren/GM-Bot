Gaunt, humanlike creatures, githyanki have\nserrated ears and speckled skin ranging through shades of yellow, green, and brown. While some githyanki follow their own paths, many are influenced by a\npast that forever altered their fates.\nHistory of the Gith\nAges ago, a humanlike people were conquered by an empire of mind flayers. The illithids manipulated this forgotten people through untold horrors, forced\nevolution, and psychic reshaping. Eventually one named Gith rose from among the captives and led a rebellion against their oppressors. Gith’s followers,\nwho became known as the gith, defeated the mind flayers and shattered their vast empire.\nThe victory of the gith was short-lived. As Gith was forging her own burgeoning empire, a leader named Zerthimon challenged her. Zerthimon claimed Gith’s\ndrive for vengeance and new conquests was evidence of species-wide mental programing laid by the mind flayers, biological manipulation that condemned\nher people to continued servitude. This claim split the gith into Gith’s followers, the githyanki (meaning “followers of Gith”), and Zerthimon’s followers, the\ngithzerai (meaning “those who spurn Gith”), and sparked an ongoing conflict.\nWhen Gith perished, her adviser, Vlaakith, assumed rule of the githyanki. Vlaakith’s line has continued to the githyanki’s current ruler, Vlaakith the Lich-\nQueen. This undead tyrant compels her people to wage endless wars against mind flayers, githzerai, and any others that threaten githyanki supremacy.\nGithyanki Warrior\nGithyanki warriors use psionic abilities to augment their battle prowess.\nLEFT TO RIGHT: GITHYANKI DRACOMANCER, GITHYANKI KNIGHT, AND GITHYANKI WARRIOR\nTo slay in Vlaakith’s name is our greatest service. To die\nin her name is our last act of reverence.\n—MELDAVH, GITHYANKI KNIGHT",
