These elusive beings pass unseen with nothing more than a stirring of air. They\ncontrol powerful winds capable of moving objects and battering foes. Magic-users conjure these creatures to serve as killers and thieves. Invisible stalkers\nrelentlessly pursue their quarry, and they rarely leave evidence of their crimes.\nIn rare cases, an invisible stalker lingers in the world without a spellcaster\ncontrolling it.
