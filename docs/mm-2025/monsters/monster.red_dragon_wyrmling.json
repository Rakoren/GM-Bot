They seek territories rich with treasures and potential followers, raiding, burning,\nand slaughtering to enforce their will. Unless these dragons meet significant resistance, they cement their power and begin reigns of terror that can last for\ncenturies.\nRed Dragon Lairs\nRed dragons make their lairs in smoldering, unapproachable places such as volcanic mountains, burning wastelands, and ruins they’ve stolen from other\ncreatures.\nThe region containing an adult or ancient red dragon’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:\nBurning Heat. The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of extreme heat. A burning creature or object takes an additional 1d4 Fire damage at the start of\neach of its turns.\nSmoldering Haze. The area within 1 mile of the lair is Lightly Obscured with clouds of ash. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies\nfinishes a Long Rest in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour.\nIf the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.\nAdult Red Dragon\nHP 75 (10d8 + 30)\nSpeed 30 ft., Climb 30 ft., Fly 60 ft.\nMOD \tSAVE\nSTR \t19 \t+4 \t+4\nDEX \t10 \t+0 \t+2\nCON \t17 \t+3 \t+3\nMOD \tSAVE\nINT \t12 \t+1 \t+1\nWIS \t11 \t+0 \t+2\nCHA \t15 \t+2 \t+2\nSkills Perception +4, Stealth +2\nImmunities Fire\nSenses Blindsight 10 ft., Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception 14\nLanguages Draconic\nCR 4 (XP 1,100; PB +2)\nActions\nMultiattack.
