They delight in wreckage—the louder, the more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better.\nGoblin raids are often as much opportunities to enjoy setting fires and tormenting livestock as they are parts of more disruptive plots.\nGoblins obey those who accomplish the wildest plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds, bombastic magic-users, or those capable of making\nthe loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful humanoids might also command ornery groups of goblins, directing their destructiveness toward banditry,\nsabotage, or war.\nThe deity Maglubiyet claims to be the god of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, and on the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, the deity commands\ninnumerable goblinoid legions. In ages long past, Maglubiyet witnessed the destructive propensity of goblinoids and relocated a population of them from\nthe Feywild to his realm on the Outer Planes. Since then, hordes of these more martial-minded goblins have flourished, with some finding their ways to\nMaterial Plane worlds.
