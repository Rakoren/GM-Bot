These scrappy menaces mimic the behaviors of their\ndragon masters. Though their small stature and recklessness make kobolds poor imitators of dragons, what they lack in ferocity they make up for in zeal\nand ingenuity. They are especially adept at creating traps and setting ambushes.\nKobolds’ scales resemble those of chromatic dragons that live near their warrens. Rarely, kobolds possess features evocative of metallic dragons or other\ndragon-like creatures.\nKobold Warrior\nKobold warriors use hit-and-run tactics to raid their enemies and defend their homes. To avoid danger, they frequently employ haphazard traps.\nMOD \tSAVE\nSTR \t20 \t+5 \t+9\nDEX \t16 \t+3 \t+3\nCON \t16 \t+3 \t+7\nMOD \tSAVE\nINT \t11 \t+0 \t+0\nWIS \t12 \t+1 \t+5\nCHA \t18 \t+4 \t+8\nSkills Athletics +9, Perception +5, Persuasion +8\nImmunities Charmed, Frightened\nGear Greatsword, Longbow, Plate Armor\nSenses Passive Perception 15\nLanguages Common plus one other language\nCR 12 (XP 8,400; PB +4)\nTraits\nAura of Bravery.
