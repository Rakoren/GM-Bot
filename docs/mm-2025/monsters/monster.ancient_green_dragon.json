They typically cooperate with one another only to defeat more powerful prey.\nMost demonstrate no interest in creating things or in communicating with other creatures, including their own kind.\nMany grells pursue methods of traveling between worlds and planes of existence. They sometimes slip onto star-faring vessels or enter portals heedless of\ntheir destination.
