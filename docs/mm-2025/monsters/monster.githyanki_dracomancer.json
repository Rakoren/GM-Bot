They share a history with githyanki as creatures physically and psychically\ntransformed by mind flayers (see the “Githyanki” section). Githzerai know that in body and mind, their species was manipulated by their former illithid\noppressors. Rather than giving in to this programming, githzerai follow the teachings of their first leader, Zerthimon, and reshape their minds and bodies to\nfind peace.\nGithzerai psychically create serene, hidden sanctuaries in chaotic reaches of the multiverse. Most of these redoubts drift through the chaotic plane of\nLimbo, but githzerai conclaves can also be found in the Abyss, the Elemental Chaos, and the Feywild. Githzerai create these cloisters to hone their psionic\nabilities, to gain insights from the multiverse, and to avoid githyanki and mind flayers.\nLanguages Common, Draconic, Gith\nCR 16 (XP 15,000; PB +5)\nActions\nMultiattack.

Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 18, each\ncreature in a 90-foot Cone.\nFailure: 27 (6d8) Fire damage plus 27 (6d8) Force\ndamage.\nSuccess: Half damage.\nSpellcasting. The githyanki casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell\ncomponents and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC\n18, +10 to hit with spell attacks):\nAt Will:\nMage Hand (the hand is Invisible)\n2/Day Each:\nNondetection (self only),\nPlane Shift,\nTongues\nBonus Actions\nMisty Step (3/Day).

They might be found beyond githzerai sanctuaries, testing\nthemselves amid the dangerous extremes of the multiverse.\nGithzerai Zerth\nGithzerai zerths embody the discipline espoused by their first leader, Zerthimon. Their psionic control aids them in protecting their people and traveling the\nplanes of existence without fear of being followed by githyanki or mind flayer foes.",
