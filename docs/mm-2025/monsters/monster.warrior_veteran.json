In the water, these creatures are indistinguishable from the\nliquid surrounding them. Should their aquatic territory be disturbed, they rise as animate water spouts with vague snake- or dragon-like features. Often their\nappearance is enough to drive off foes, but if forced to fight, water weirds crush enemies within their fluid coils.\nWater weirds might protect a site for generations and learn much about their surroundings. Some gain reputations as oracles and might respond to\nquestions posed to them in Primordial. Since water weirds don’t speak, they often communicate using spouts of water or objects submerged in their pools.\nWater: greatest of the elements in might and form. A tsunami’s\ntorrent. A blizzard’s claws. A parent’s tears. What is not moved\nby water?\n—KALBARI, MOTHER OF FOAM, RULER OF MARIDS",
