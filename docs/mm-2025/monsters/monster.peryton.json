These\nhorse-size, magical arachnids are endemic to the Ethereal Plane. From vaporous\nlairs, they peer through the Border Ethereal into the Material Plane. When they\ndetect prey, phase spiders draw close and then shift or “phase” to the Material\nPlane to attack. They shift between planes of existence and attack from\nunexpected directions until they overcome their prey or are forced to retreat.\nPhase spiders are more intelligent than mundane spiders, but most are cowards.\nThey usually flee if they’re outnumbered by creatures capable of seeing them on\nthe Ethereal Plane or pursuing them there. They make exceptions for ghosts and\nsimilar spirits, which phase spiders gain sustenance from and pursue as favored\nprey.\nCR 2 (XP 450; PB +2)\nTraits\nFlyby.
