With bodies of flame and magmatic rock, these\nhalfling-size creatures delight in setting fires. They do so not out of malice but out of enthusiasm for primal fire. They don’t consider that objects have value\nbeyond kindling or that creatures can be harmed by flames. If such concepts are explained to them, they find the ideas difficult to grasp and don’t remember\nthem for long. Rather, they relish every opportunity to set flammable things alight, delighting in igniting paper, wooden structures, and explosives. Magmins\nare dangerous even in death, since they explode when they’re destroyed, their flames igniting combustible materials nearby.\nMagmins might be conjured by magic-users to harry foes or might escape the Elemental Plane of Fire through portals or rifts that lead to other realms.\nThey’re attracted to places of intense heat, such as volcanoes and rivers of magma. If they can’t find such favored conditions, magmins eagerly burn\nstructures or start wildfires to entertain themselves.\nManes\nDemons of Panic and Frenzy\nHabitat: Planar (Abyss); Treasure: None",
