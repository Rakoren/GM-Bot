They ruthlessly hunt creatures that enter their territories, whether such places are Abyssal\nwildernesses or locations where these demons have been conjured by wicked magic-users. Barlguras litter their territories with fiendish icons and terrifying\nevidence of their kills.\nBarlguras cooperate with other demons, particularly other barlguras, so long as they have ample prey. Should a region be depleted of creatures to slaughter,\nthese demons turn on one another in frays that can devastate vast expanses.\nBarlguras vary in appearance, but all have powerful frames and hands capable of climbing swiftly and delivering crushing blows. If brute force isn’t enough\nto overwhelm their foes, barlguras can use demonic magic to conjure terrifying illusions and grasping vines. Most barlguras resemble nightmarish apes,\nand some bear exaggerated versions of features of predators common to the lands the barlguras inhabit. Many embed trophies from past hunts in their\ndemonic bodies.",
