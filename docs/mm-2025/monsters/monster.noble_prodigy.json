The bodies of these\nformer scholars are warped into otherworldly shapes, each with a head dominated by a gigantic, unblinking eye. Nothics remember nothing of their past\nlives and care only for their endless pursuit of hidden mysteries and uncanny truths. They seek revelations amid the rubble of forgotten ruins, and they use\ntheir supernatural sight to pierce magical deceptions, rot the flesh of enemies, and steal the secrets of those who interrupt their investigations.\nSome nothics seek to end the curse that warped them into their bizarre forms, but many are unaware of—or uninterested in—their transformation.\nNycaloth\nYugoloth of Strategy and Strife\nHabitat: Planar (Gehenna); Treasure: Armaments\nDeeper.
