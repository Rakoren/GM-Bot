A dracolich retains a breath weapon, but it is a chilling\nnecrotic blast. These terrors gradually sicken the land near their lairs and attract sinister followers—usually other undead or cultists seeking to revel in their\nterrible might. Living dragons of all types loathe and seek to destroy dracoliches, viewing them as distortions of draconic magic.\nThere are untold profane routes by which a dragon might become a dracolich. However one is created, a dracolich chooses a gem that becomes the anchor\nfor its spirit and binds the deathless dragon to the world. So long as a dracolich is on the same plane of existence as its soul gem, the dracolich can survive\nthe destruction of its physical body. Its spirit retreats into the gem if the dracolich’s body is destroyed, and the monster might one day regain its terrifying\nform. Dracoliches often sequester their soul gems within meaningful treasure from their hoard or in unassuming baubles. Roll on or choose a result from\nthe Dracolich Soul Gem Vessels table to inspire what holds a dracolich’s soul gem.\nDracolich Soul Gem Vessels\n1d10 \tA Dracolich’s Soul Gem Is Hidden In...\n1 \tAnother dragon’s treasure hoard.\n2 \tThe body of a servant or an ancestor.\n3 \tThe core of a dracolich’s melted hoard.\n4 \tA corrupted dragon egg.\n5 \tA dragon horn a hero took as a trophy.\n6 \tA nation’s royal or religious treasure.\n7 \tA powerful magic item.\n8 \tA source of magical wonders, such as a giant tree or mystical pool.\n9 \tThe vault of an archdevil, a wicked god, or another extraplanar villain.\n10 \tThe weapon that slew the dracolich.\nDracolich Lairs\nA dracolich lurks in a corrupted version of the lair it had in life. The region containing a dracolich’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following\neffects:\nSapping Mist. The area within 1 mile of the lair is Lightly Obscured by pale fog. Whenever a creature other than the dracolich or one of its allies finishes a\nLong Rest in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.\nSoul Drain. Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have Disadvantage on Death Saving Throws.\nIf the dracolich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the dracolich gains a new body (see its Soul\nGem trait).",
