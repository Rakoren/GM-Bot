Standing three times the size of most humans, these giants exhibit skin and hair in a range of shades,\nincluding hues suggestive of the earth and mosses near their dwellings.\nAmong hidden valleys, pristine waterfalls, and game-filled slopes, hill giants usually find their needs met by nature’s bounty. What the wilderness doesn’t\nprovide, hill giants make, crafting clothes, tools, and weapons from rocks, wood, and hides. When they encounter strangers, hill giants might be suspicious\nand protective of their territories, but some might be convinced to share their bounties with travelers willing to entertain them.\nDisaster, invasion, or want might drive hill giants from their homes into other people’s lands. Some displaced hill giants might steal what they need or seek\nrevenge for their losses by causing ruin among smaller beings. Others might take up lives of raiding or serve other giants in return for protection.\nHippogriff\nWorld-Traveling Hunter and Steed\nHabitat: Grassland, Hill, Mountain; Treasure: None",
