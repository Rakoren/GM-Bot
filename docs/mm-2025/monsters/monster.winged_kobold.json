These massive, many-\ntentacled horrors combine overwhelming physical might with formidable cunning. Their powerful limbs shatter ships and topple spires, and they use their\ncontrol over storms to rain down lightning on their foes.\nKrakens usually have little interest in mortal affairs. These terrors were created by the gods to wage war in ages long forgotten. Since that era, most\nkrakens have vanished beneath the waves to slumber until the gods call on them again. Some krakens serve divine masters still, protecting deep sea\ntreasures or entire oceans. Others have forsaken their divine creators and pursue their own agendas, manipulating forces beneath the sea and beyond.\nKrakens rarely appear on the surface, but when they do, they herald times of change and doom. When roused to action, these titans directly attack coastal\ncities or whole armadas. Kraken onslaughts persist until their wrath is sated, their divine patrons are appeased, or their egos are placated by valuable\nofferings. Roll on or choose a result from the Kraken Attacks table to inspire what ruin a kraken might unleash.\nKraken Attacks\n1d8 \tThe Enraged Kraken...\n1 \tAbducts the vessel of a leader or another important community member.\n2 \tAttacks a community from below using flooded ruins, hidden aquifers, or sewers.\n3 \tBreaks a lighthouse or seaside tower, carrying it and the occupants to a secret island.\n4 \tCalls down lightning on any ship that enters its aquatic territory.\n5 \tCarries ships to an inescapable sargassum.\n6 \tDams a river or cuts off a city’s sea access.\n7 \tDevours all sea life near a fishing community, threatening it with ruin.\n8 \tMasterminds an invasion from the sea by merfolk, sahuagin, or storm giants.\nKraken Lairs\nKraken lairs tend to be sunken temples, eldritch ritual sites, or primeval places of divine power. They might lie deep beneath bodies of fresh or salt water,\nand they often connect to labyrinths of flooded subterranean tunnels or networks of magical portals.\nThe region containing a kraken’s lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:\nOcean Tyrant. The kraken exerts its dominance over animals in its domain. All Beasts within 1 mile of the lair have the Charmed condition while in that\narea.\nSea and Storms. While in its lair, the kraken can cast\nControl Weather, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.\nIf the kraken dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.\nKuo-toa\nFishlike Fanatics of the Deep\nHabitat: Coastal, Underdark; Treasure: Relics",
