These inhabitants of the clockwork plane of Mechanus tend to the incredible mechanisms\nof their orderly home and oppose chaotic forces across the multiverse.\nModrons are parts of a vast hierarchy, spanning from quirky monodrones to the leader of their kind, the godlike Primus. Every modron carries out tasks\nassigned to it by higher-ranking modrons, doing so without question. Generally, modrons communicate only with other modrons of their own rank or the\nranks immediately above and below them. Those more than one rank away tend to be either too advanced or too simple for them to understand.\nModrons excel at tasks that require patience and precision, but they have little understanding of nonliteral concepts such as art or humor. They have no\negos; they have only their work and the certainty that multiversal law depends on their efficacy.\nIn rare cases, a modron goes rogue and develops its own will. In these cases, other modrons are sent to recover or destroy their malfunctioning kin.\nModron Marches\nWhether in service to lawful deities or as part of the Great Modron March, modrons travel from Mechanus to spread their vision of law to other planes of\nexistence. Roll on or choose a result from the Modron Operations table to inspire what effort leads a group of modrons to other realms.",
