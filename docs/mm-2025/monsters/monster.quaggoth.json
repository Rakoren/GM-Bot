These tiny demons use chaos and violence\nto terrorize others. By shape-shifting into harmless but ill-omened\ncreatures or by turning invisible, quasits sneak into places where they\nspy for villainous masters or set vicious traps. Quasits delight in hiding\nin dark places and—when least expected—bursting forth to slash foes\nwith their poisoned claws.\nQuasits are usually overlooked and underestimated by other demons.\nThis drives them to prove themselves through cruel acts or by seeking\npaths to the Material Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow senseless\nchaos, and they might find kindred evil spirits among violent cultists\nand magic-users.",
