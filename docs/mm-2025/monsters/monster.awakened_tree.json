Swift predators, they chase down prey and use their beaks to hack\nthrough foliage protecting their quarry. Axe beaks live in varied\nenvironments. Colorfully plumed axe beaks race across tropical plains,\nwhile axe beaks with snowy feathers hunt the tundra.\nAxe beaks are difficult to train, but those hatched and raised in captivity can\nbecome reliable mounts.\nAxe Beak\nAlone or in small groups, axe beaks stalk prey to feed their flocks. When working together, axe beaks use rudimentary tactics, with some distracting threats\nwhile others strike vulnerable targets or rush young axe beaks to safety.\nGiant Axe Beak\nGiant axe beaks typically dwell in secluded, primeval realms, such as isolated islands or underground wildernesses. They often compete with dinosaurs\nand other giant beasts for territory.\nResistances Bludgeoning, Piercing\nSenses Passive Perception 10\nLanguages Common plus one other language\nCR 2 (XP 450; PB +2)\nActions\nSlam.
