They can alter their color,\ntexture, and dimensions to duplicate inanimate objects of their approximate size. Mimics use their disguises as both camouflage and bait. Once victims\ndraw close, mimics strike, lashing out with their sticky pseudopods and toothy mouths. After consuming victims, mimics usually relocate, change form, and\nawait their next meal.\nUse the following list to inspire mimics’ shapes:\nAltar\nBell\nBoulder\nCauldron\nChair\nChandelier\nChest\nCot\nDoor\nFloor mat\nGiant gemstone\nGravestone\nHeap of leaves\nKeg\nLadder\nLectern\nMannequin\nMirror\nObelisk\nOversize cake\nPanel of levers\nPile of bones\nPotted plant\nRow of books\nSarcophagus\nSculpture\nShip’s wheel\nSign\nStalagmite\nStump\nTable\nTapestry\nTaxidermy\nThrone\nTopiary\nWeapon rack",
