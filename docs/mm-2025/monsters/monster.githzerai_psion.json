Glabrezus seek routes to the Material Plane and relish being summoned\nby magic-users. They eagerly serve mortals while tempting them to betray their allies and indulge in hubristic fantasies. A glabrezu strives to murder its\nsummoner once the magic-user has committed irredeemable misdeeds and the mortal’s soul is surely condemned to the Abyss.\nYour companion’s life, or what you’ve journeyed through infinity\nin search of!
