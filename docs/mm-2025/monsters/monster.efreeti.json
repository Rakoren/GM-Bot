Within the vastness and violence of this realm\nrage elemental cataclysms, entities spawned from the raw forces of the multiverse and awash in dissonant elemental powers. These beings of primal\nconflict annihilate nearly all they encounter and seed the ruins left in their wake with the potential for new creations.\nElemental cataclysms rarely escape the Elemental Chaos. When they do, it is typically due to some planar disruption or the summons of nihilistic cultists.\nWhen they emerge on Material Plane worlds, elemental cataclysms create realm-altering trails of destruction, carelessly destroying cities and throwing\nwhole nations into chaos. The rampages aren’t random. Elemental cataclysms abhor anything that visibly mars nature, be it mines or monuments,\nfortresses or cities, but they vent their most intense rage on works of metal and clockwork. As they sow destruction, they howl condemnation and chant\nwords of unmaking in the languages of the Inner Planes.\nLittle can stop an elemental cataclysm. Those that oppose one of these calamities often attempt to reverse the ritual that summoned it, coax it through a\nplanar rift, or conjure another titan in hopes that the two destroy one another. These terrors leave a wake of ashes, floods, storms, and broken earth. But\nafter these disasters recede, the land is imbued with new life or environmental changes. Roll on or choose a result from the Elemental Alterations table to\ninspire what changes emerge after an elemental cataclysm’s destruction.\nElemental Alterations\n1d8 \tThe Elemental Cataclysm Leaves Behind A...\n1 \tDramatic increase or decrease in temperature.\n2 \tGigantic coral reef or fungal forest.\n3 \tNever-ending storm or whirlpool.\n4 \tPassage to the Underdark or portal to an Elemental Plane.\n5 \tPrimeval or previously extinct animal population.\n6 \tRapidly growing rainforest.\n7 \tRiver where previously there was none.\n8 \tSeries of dramatic rock formations.\nEmpyreans\nScions of the Gods",
