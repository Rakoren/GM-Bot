The wicked\ngod Lolth is fond of transforming her drow worshipers into driders, as\neither a blessing or a curse. These driders often become fanatical\nservants of their god, or they are overwhelmed by their transformation\nand live only to indulge their predatory arachnid instincts.\nDriders also appear when whole communities are transformed by a\nwicked god’s wrath or other magical means, or driders might be part of\na world’s natural population. Most dwell underground or in dense\nforests where they can make the most of their spiderlike traits. Driders\nwith non-drow features are uncommon but possible.
