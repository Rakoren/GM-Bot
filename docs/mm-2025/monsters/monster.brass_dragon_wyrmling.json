Some work closely with other metallic\ndragons, carrying information between allies.\nBrass Dragon Lairs\nBrass dragons usually dwell in secret caves and canyons near well-traveled routes.\nThe area containing an adult or ancient brass dragon’s lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:\nMirages. While in its lair, the dragon can cast\nMajor Image, requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting\naction. When casting the spell this way, the spell’s range is 1 mile, and the dragon doesn’t need to see the spot where the illusion appears.\nRefreshing Water. Water within 1 mile of the lair is magically refreshing. A creature that drinks such water gains 2d4 Temporary Hit Points, and the dragon\nis immediately aware of the creature’s presence.\nIf the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.\nAdult Brass Dragon\nMOD \tSAVE\nSTR \t15 \t+2 \t+2\nDEX \t10 \t+0 \t+2\nCON \t13 \t+1 \t+1\nMOD \tSAVE\nINT \t10 \t+0 \t+0\nWIS \t11 \t+0 \t+2\nCHA \t13 \t+1 \t+1\nSkills Perception +4, Stealth +2\nImmunities Fire\nSenses Blindsight 10 ft., Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception 14\nLanguages Draconic\nCR 1 (XP 200; PB +2)\nActions\nRend.
