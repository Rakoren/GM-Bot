These vicious, two-headed canines ambush creatures they perceive as weaker than themselves,\nfavoring the wounded or infirm. They attack recklessly, infecting as many creatures as possible with their diseased jaws. If driven off, death dogs linger\nclose to their victims, letting infection weaken their prey before they attack again.\nLegends tie death dogs to malicious death gods, the underworld, and cursed rulers. These stories are based on the malady death dogs spread. Roll on or\nchoose a result from the Death Dog Malady Symptoms table to inspire symptoms spread by a death dog’s bite. These symptoms are cosmetic and don’t\nalter the effects of the death dog’s Bite action. The symptoms vanish when a creature no longer has the Poisoned condition from a death dog’s Bite.\nDeath Dog Malady Symptoms\n1d6 \tThe Death Dog’s Malady Causes...\n1 \tMarks from canine jaws to appear on the victim’s body, as if they were still being mauled.\n2 \tThe victim’s body to wither, as if constantly exposed to desert heat.\n3 \tThe victim to be distracted by distant howling or vague whispers only they can hear.\n4 \tThe victim’s flesh to rot like a corpse.\n5 \tThe victim to itch, as if they had fleas or sand beneath their skin.\n6 \tWicked symbols to gradually appear on and spread across the victim’s body.\nDeath Knights\nHaunted Commanders of Unliving Legions\nHabitat: Any; Treasure: Armaments",
