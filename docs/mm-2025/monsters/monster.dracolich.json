While some of these\naquatic dragons contentedly slumber in the depths, others jealously guard vast territories with their scalding breath and lay claim to anything that sinks\ninto the depths or sails on the waves. Occasionally these dragons agree to aid pirates, aquatic peoples, or oceanic religions in return for contributions to\ntheir sunken treasure hoards.\nMany dragon turtles live in secluded lairs or ruins deep underwater, and they might not be spotted by surface dwellers for generations. Like both their\nnamesakes, dragon turtles can have exceptionally long lives. Some recall the wonders of ages past or remarkable individuals that passed through their\nrealms long ago. Such dragon turtles might be convinced to share their tales or provide guidance through their territories in exchange for treasures they’ve\nnever glimpsed on the ocean floor.\nDretches\nDemons of Frenzy and Vulgarity",
