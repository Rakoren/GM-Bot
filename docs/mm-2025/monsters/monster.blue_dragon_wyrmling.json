Many claim isolated communities to rule over or ancient ruins where they might\nfind magical paths to power. These blue dragons might temporarily cooperate with other dragons or powerful villains to gain followers and influence.\nBlue Dragon Lairs\nBlue dragons dwell in arid lands. Their lairs might be death traps meant to entomb invaders or ostentatious fortresses where they plot domination.\nThe region containing an adult or ancient blue dragon’s lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:\nSinkholes. Sinkholes form more frequently in the area within 1 mile of the lair. Whenever a creature in that area other than the dragon and its allies finishes\na Long Rest, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sinkhole opens beneath the creature, and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 2d4 × 10 feet\ninto the sinkhole.\nSpiteful Storms. Dust devils and thunderstorms rage within 1 mile of the lair. The area is Lightly Obscured.\nIf the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.\nAdult Blue Dragon\nSenses Blindsight 10 ft., Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception 14\nLanguages Draconic\nCR 3 (XP 700; PB +2)\nActions\nMultiattack.
