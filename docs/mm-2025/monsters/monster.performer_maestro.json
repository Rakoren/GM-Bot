Their prestige might grant them access to the heights of society, or they\nmight use their performances to manipulate audiences. Performer legends usually have signature traits or talents that set them apart from other\nentertainers, such as a distinct voice, incredible athleticism, or a unique manner of dress. They often travel with a retinue of other performers, guards, or\nnoble patrons.\nPeryton\nWinged Heart Hunter\nHabitat: Hill, Mountain; Treasure: Armaments\nWelcome, one! Welcome, all!
