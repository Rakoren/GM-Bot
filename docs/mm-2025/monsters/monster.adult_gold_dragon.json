In addition to goring foes\nwith their deadly horns and trampling them under their iron hooves, gorgons exhale gouts of noxious gas.\nGorgons are created by magic-users to serve as guardians. The process for creating a gorgon is labor intensive and dangerous, with one method requiring\nthe skeleton of a bull, the blood of a medusa, and the brain of a basilisk fused into a frame of ensorcelled iron. If the process fails, petrifying gas emerges\nfrom the materials, creating a magical threat that can fill a structure and linger for years.\nWhen magic-users create gorgons, they often enchant them to ignore those who confront the creature with a specific command key, usually a password or\na specific signal. Once a gorgon is set to guard an area, it attacks any who enter until they flee or are destroyed. Should someone provide the command key,\nthe monster ignores that intruder so long as the intruder remains in its sight. But if the intruder ventures out of sight and then returns without again\npresenting the command key, the gorgon attacks. Those in a gorgon’s territory must remain vigilant and aware of the monster’s exact position, or they risk\nbeing attacked by a gorgon they thought was no longer a threat.\nThose who create gorgons strive to give them purposefully obscure command keys. Hints at command keys might be found among the records of a\ngorgon’s creator or in the area the gorgon protects—perhaps scrawled as a petrified trespasser’s final act. Roll on or choose a result from the Gorgon\nCommand Keys table to inspire the word or signal that temporarily neutralizes a gorgon.\nGorgon Command Keys\n1d6 \tGorgon Won’t Attack Those That...\n1 \tCast a particular spell in the gorgon’s presence.\n2 \tKeep their back to the gorgon or otherwise act like they don’t see the monster.\n3 \tOffer it a drink of blood, water, or wine.\nA GORGON PETRIFIES VICTIMS WITH ITS DEADLY BREATH, THEN TRAMPLES THEM TO PIECES\nNotable among my eccentric ancestor’s scattered designs was\na schematic of a swamp-dwelling bovine monster and an\nominous note: “Do better.”\n—LUM THE MAESTRO,\nA MIND OF METAL\n1d6 \tGorgon Won’t Attack Those That...\n4 \tRecite a specific rhyme or sing a certain song.\n5 \tSay its creator’s name backward.\n6 \tWear a mask, perhaps in the shape of a bull or an animal meaningful to the gorgon’s creator.\nGorgon\nMost gorgons are iron bulls wreathed in clouds of petrifying gas. Their metal plates vary in sheen and color, from sleek silver to pitted black. The oldest\ngorgons might be covered in rust, but this rarely impedes their abilities. These gorgons’ stomping grounds are littered with the shattered remains of petrified\nfoes. Many gorgons outlive their creators by centuries, misleading some to believe these creations have natural origins and territories. Most such gorgons\ncontinue to follow age-old commands, guarding sites long fallen to ruin.\nBrazen Gorgon\nFollowers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the process of creating gorgons to craft their own diabolical guardians called brazen gorgons. These\ngorgons are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal bodies glow with intense heat. When they charge their foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages\nto ensnare enemies and roast them within. Brazen gorgons are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated to Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty\ngods.",
