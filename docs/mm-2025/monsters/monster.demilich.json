These immortal messengers adopt the\nshapes of mystical beasts or idealized, winged mortals. As with all angels, their\ntrue forms are known only to the gods they serve.\nRather than literal correspondence from a god, a deva conveys an allegory or\nquest to mortals, tasking them with delivering something to its rightful place.\nWhile the angel might be called on in times of need, it encourages mortal\nheroism. Should a deva’s chosen champions carry out their charge, they\nexperience a revelation or the world is changed in line with divine purpose. Roll on\nor choose a result from the Deva Messages table to inspire a deva’s charge.\nDeva Messages\n1d6 \tThe Deva Tasks a Mortal with Delivering...\n1 \tThe corpse of a hero in need of redemption.\n2 \tThe cure for a plague in a distant land.\n3 \tA holy coffer that must not be opened.\n4 \tA magic weapon usable only by a true hero.\n5 \tA seedling that wilts if exposed to anger.\n6 \tSomeone from another world with a prophesied purpose but no memory.",
