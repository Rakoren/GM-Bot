With the bodies of mighty avian scavengers\nand fanged, stag-like heads, perytons use ambush tactics to dive-bomb travelers. Strangely, the shadows they cast resemble humanoid silhouettes. This\nsupernatural oddity lends credence to stories that perytons are cursed humans or elves, or that they arise from carrion birds that feed on the corpses of\nvillains.\nPerytons tear out the hearts of those they slay, carrying the organs back to grisly lairs.
