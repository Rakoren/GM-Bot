Success: Half damage. 4. Swallowing Earth. Strength Saving Throw: DC 23, each creature in a 90-foot Cube originating from a point on the ground within 150 feet. Failure: 18 (4d8) Bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) Acid damage, and the target has the Prone condition and is buried under rubble. A buried target has the Restrained condition, has Total Cover, and is suffocating. As an action, a buried creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can make a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature is no longer buried. Success: Half damage only."

While not gods themselves, they possess divine influence and powers related to their divine parents. Some empyreans\nare near-demigods with fantastic might and the power to reshape mortal lives. Others are little more than divine thoughts or moments of immortal attention\nmade manifest. Whether empyreans are idealized beings or vestiges of divinity, their appearances are influenced by their creators. Roll on or choose a result\nfrom the Empyrean Influences table to inspire what aspects of an empyrean’s heritage manifest in its physical form.\nEmpyrean Influences\n1d6 \tThe Empyrean Has Features That Are...\n1 \tBalanced, naturalistic, or suggestive of watching eyes.\n2 \tColorful, shadowy, or fluid or that vary depending on the viewer.\n3 \tComforting and gentle or that remind viewers of pleasant memories.\n4 \tDisconnected parts, visible thoughts, or errant shapes.\n5 \tMachinelike, stoic, symmetrical, or suggestive of judgment.\n6 \tMorbid, menacing, or monstrous or that embody the viewer’s fears.\nEmpyrean Iota\nEmpyrean iotas are the thoughts, memories, or indirect attentions of deities personified and given a measure of autonomy. Resembling floating glyphs,\nmotes of color, icons of divinity, or stranger shapes, these beings are messengers of the gods and aides to those gods’ servants. Iotas have their own\nknowledge and personalities, though they might know little more than the realms and wishes of their creators.\nCELESTIAL AND FIENDISH EMPYREANS OBSERVE THE COSMOS ATTENDED BY SIGIL-LIKE EMPYREAN IOTAS",
