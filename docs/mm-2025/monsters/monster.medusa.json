The six most prominent types of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with\nwings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed of two elements. Most live self-interested existences, indulging their warped senses of humor or\noverblown egos on their home planes of existence. Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or magic-users.\nMephits resent leaving the elemental extremes where they make their homes. If loosed on the Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with nasty\npranks or by tormenting weaker creatures. When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental magic.\nDust Mephit\nDust mephits are composed of air and fine earth. They are drawn to forsaken places, and they think everything associated with death is hilarious.\nIce Mephit\nIce mephits have bodies made of frigid air and frozen water. They delight in freezing things and dropping ice into peoples’ clothes.",
