Arising from the souls of tyrants, moments of catastrophic pain, or magical\nblasphemies, wraiths spread suffering and the torment of undeath. Humanoids that die near a wraith might be entrapped by the foul spirit and rise as\nspecters bound to the wraith’s sinister will.\nWraiths lurk in forgotten dungeons, accursed ruins, or lands influenced by sinister planes of existence. Such haunted domains might bear hints of the\ntragedies or foul magic that brought the wraiths into being.",
