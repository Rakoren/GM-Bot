Flumphs number among the few that are helpful to strangers.\nThese tentacled, telepathic creatures jet through the air in short bursts, venting gases with a sound that gives them their name. Rather than speaking,\nflumphs communicate telepathically and by changing color to reflect their moods.\nFlumphs dwell in psychically charged regions or near creatures with psionic magic. They harmlessly feed off psychic energies, but in doing so, they often\nencounter dangerous beings such as aboleths and mind flayers. While flumphs generally avoid combat, they often help adventurers in peril. Such help\nmight be of doubtful use, but flumphs mean well. Roll on or choose a result from the Flumph Assistance table to inspire what support flumphs provide.\nFlumph Assistance\n1d6 \tThe Flumph Helps By...\n1 \tCooking a meal of Underdark delicacies.\n2 \tPerforming a psychic song or “smell poem.”\n3 \tRecovering and nursing fallen adventurers.\n4 \tRevealing the location of helpful magic items.\n5 \tServing as a guide to a foe’s hidden lair.\n6 \tSharing excessive encouragement and praise.\nFlumph Colors\nA flumph’s extremities change color to reflect its mood. The Flumph Colors and Emotions table summarizes common flumph colors and the human\nemotions to which they most closely correspond.\nFlumph Colors and Emotions\nColor \tEmotion\nBlue, Dark \tSadness\nBlue, Light \tHappiness\nGreen \tCuriosity\nMagenta \tUnknown*\n*Rarely seen; potentially no human equivalent\nColor \tEmotion\nOrange \tConfusion\nPink \tAmusement\nPurple \tFear\nRed \tAnger\nTeal \tSerenity\nYellow \tExcitement\n*Rarely seen; potentially no human equivalent\nFomorian\nCursed Giant of the Dark\nHabitat: Underdark; Treasure: Any",
