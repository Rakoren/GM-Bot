These mind-\nbending terrors sing and scream, laugh and cry with a cacophony of voices ranging from disturbingly unnatural to shockingly familiar. They exist only to\nfeed and to unleash their disdain for reality, their many maws dripping with otherworldly spittle.\nGibbering mouthers come into being in various unpleasant ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Gibbering Mouther Nascencies table to inspire what\nbrought one of these horrors into being.",
