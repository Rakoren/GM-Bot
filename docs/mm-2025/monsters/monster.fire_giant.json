They serve their reckless creators,\nbut many possess disjointed memories and instincts from their component parts. If wounded, these golems might go berserk and vent their confusion on\nanything in their sight, including their creators.\nFlesh golems appear in varied forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Flesh Golem Characteristics table to inspire a flesh golem’s features.\nI never cared for warmth. I never needed a body.
