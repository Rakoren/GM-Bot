While other chromatic dragons scheme for power and wealth, these dragons seek to tear down all they see and\nrule over what remains.\nBlack dragons are terrifying creatures with curved horns and withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant swamps,\ncrumbling ruins, or places of magical or environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars their domains, eroding the features from ancient statues and\nleaving nature with festering wounds.\nBlack dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope and relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons prize it—\nparticularly if they were responsible for it being lost.\nBlack Dragon Wyrmling\nBlack dragon wyrmlings lurk in bogs and polluted waterways, hunting for prey and weaker creatures to overpower. While older wyrmlings eventually seek\ntheir own territories, recently hatched ones might hunt one another, seeking dominance over their clutch and slaying rivals they can’t subjugate.",
