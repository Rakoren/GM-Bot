The materials used in creating clay golems originate from\nnear the location the golems protect and often have special significance to their creators, such as clay from a holy site or bricks from a magical ruin. While\nsome clay golems are masterfully sculpted to resemble living beings, others have only vaguely humanlike forms.\nThese golems obey their creators’ orders and protect what their makers value most. Some still\nfollow these orders long after their creators’ deaths.
