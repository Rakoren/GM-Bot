While they might have once been other types of dragons, the influence of planar forces, negative energy,\nor sinister magic has stripped them of their former color or luster. In place of any former breath weapon, shadow dragons exhale caliginous gouts that saps\nlife from everything it touches. Those slain by a shadow dragon’s breath rise as shades obedient to the shadow dragon’s will.\nShadow dragons typically dwell in the Underdark, particularly in areas with connections to the Shadowfell or other tenebrous realms. In some cases, they\nmight lurk in dark, corrupted reaches of the regions they preferred before transforming into shadow dragons. Overgrown swamps, sepulchral desert ruins,\nand ash-choked volcanoes make natural lairs for shadow dragons.\nLike many other dragons, shadow dragons collect hoards. Their tastes tend to be morbid—collecting coins from ruined empires and their victims’ skulls.\nA SHADOW DRAGON LURKS AMONG HAUNTED RUINS, ATTENDED BY SHADOWS RAISED BY ITS LIFE-DRAINING BREATH",
