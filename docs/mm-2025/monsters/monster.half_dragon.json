These monsters combine humanlike features with the talons and wings\nof avian scavengers. Their notorious songs compel listeners to follow them, heedless of danger. Creatures captivated by a harpy’s song frequently meet\ntheir deaths on harpies’ vicious claws or amid natural perils.\nHarpies dwell in remote, dismal places tainted by tragedy and despair. Some tales claim harpies offended the gods and were transformed as a punishment;\nharpies might also be the descendants of such cursed souls.\nEvery harpy sings a distinct song. While some songs are said to be heartbreaking in their beauty, others are wretched squawking and compel only the\nmagically enthralled.\nMOD \tSAVE\nSTR \t19 \t+4 \t+4\nDEX \t14 \t+2 \t+5\nCON \t16 \t+3 \t+3\nMOD \tSAVE\nINT \t10 \t+0 \t+0\nWIS \t15 \t+2 \t+5\nCHA \t14 \t+2 \t+2\nSkills Athletics +7, Perception +5, Stealth +5\nResistances Damage type chosen for the Draconic Origin trait below\nSenses Blindsight 10 ft., Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception 15\nLanguages Common, Draconic\nCR 5 (XP 1,800; PB +3)\nTraits\nDraconic Origin.

On their home planes of existence, these grim canines ensure that souls don’t escape their bleak afterlives. On the Material Plane, hell hounds\ntypically serve cruel masters—such as fire giants and cultists—who appreciate their viciousness, obedience, and fiery characteristics. Hell hounds serve\nother creatures so long as they’re given opportunities to hunt and kill, but they’re quick to turn on those who treat them as mere animals.\nHell hounds have greater cunning than normal canines. They’re skilled trackers and work together well in packs, often employing tricks and ambushes. Hell\nhounds enjoy hearing prey scream in their scorching jaws and fiery breath. They often go out of their way to draw out the terror of their victims’ final\nmoments.",
