They are the servants of just deities and ageless forces\nof good. Their interests span the planes, but they rarely intervene in conflicts on the worlds of the Material Plane. When they act, they lead vast angelic\nhosts and wield holy weapons capable of laying low the wickedest Fiends.\nSolars can resurrect the dead and often use that power to enlist mortal aid. They bestow grand, new purposes on those they return to life. Solars don’t\nenforce these destinies, but they trust in the potential of mortals to achieve great things.\nFight a slaad and lose, the story’s over. Fight a slaad and win,\nthere’s a thousand more standing in line just to prove they’re\ntougher.\n—JEBEEL SLOOM, GUIDE TO THE PLANE OF LIMBO",
