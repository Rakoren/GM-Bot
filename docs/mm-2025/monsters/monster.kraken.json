They claim they once dominated whole worlds, their empires spanning\nland and sea under the blessings of piscine gods. The kuo-toa can’t say what disaster brought their glorious civilization to an end, but elves, humans, mind\nflayers, and the kuo-toan gods bear the brunt of their blame. From the lands and seas of the surface, the kuo-toa retreated into cavernous trenches and\nUnderdark seas. In these hidden realms, kuo-toa brood over all they’ve lost and forgotten, nursing plots to avenge themselves for slights that might never\nhave occurred.\nKuo-toa hate the civilizations of the surface and the Underdark, believing themselves to be victims of age-old slights and ongoing conspiracies. Kuo-toa\nundertake contrived plots to propel themselves to dominance, often kidnapping people to learn their secrets or making dubious sacrifices to bizarre gods.\nTo facilitate such plots, kuo-toa try to capture creatures alive using nets or strange weapons. Drow, dwarves, and gnomes dwelling in the Underdark, as well\nas surface communities near submerged subterranean passages, are frequent targets for kuo-toa raids and other plots.\nKuo-toa frequently serve depraved masterminds such as aboleths and krakens. Such kuo-toa believe these powerful creatures are avatars of kuo-toan\ndeities or gods in their own right. Kuo-toa might temporarily ally with other evil creatures, but these alliances shift as kuo-toa leaders interpret omens from\ntheir unpredictable deities.\nKuo-toa Deities\nKuo-toa ever seek to placate their inscrutable deities. However, few kuo-toa can agree on the identities of their gods, and little consistency exists between\nkuo-toa communities. Only Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, a figure with a human body but the head and claws of a crayfish, sees broad worship.\nLacking information about what their other gods look like, kuo-toa priests invent new forms for them, creating divine idols with whatever objects are at\nhand. But whether these kuo-toa priests draw power from belief or delusion, aberrant talent, or a stranger supernatural source, some power answers their\npetitions. Roll twice on or choose results from the Kuo-toa Deity Features table to inspire how kuo-toa represent a deity.\nKuo-toa Deity Features\nAN ADVENTURER STUMBLES ON A KUO-TOA ARCHPRIEST AND SERVANTS OF ITS STRANGE GODS\nWhen the Corpse Moon rises and the Chum-Tide washes in, up\nrise the Gogglers from their pits beneath the waves. Burbling\nand noisome they come, fishing night’s shores as we do dawn’s\nwaves.\n—TAK MERAKIN, HARBOR MASTER OF THE STYES\n1d10 \tThe Deity’s Head Is Like A...\n1 \tBarnacle\n2 \tCrab claw\n3 \tHagfish\n4 \tMoray eel\n5 \tSea anemone\n6 \tShark\n7 \tSunfish\n8 \tTentacle\n9 \tTreasure chest\n10 \tViperfish\n1d10 \tThe Deity’s Body Is Like A...\n1 \tHermit crab\n2 \tJellyfish\n3 \tKuo-toa\n4 \tMantis shrimp\n5 \tMerfolk\n6 \tPlesiosaurus\n7 \tSea cucumber\n8 \tShip’s figurehead\n9 \tSquid\n10 \tWhale\nKuo-toa Sanctuaries\nKuo-toa typically organize their communities around sites they believe to be important to their deities. These might be structures or series of caverns, and\nmost feature both air-filled and submerged chambers. Important places within these sites suggest the rituals of kuo-toa faiths, the demands of kuo-toa\ndeities, or the whims of omen-seeking archpriests. As with kuo-toa deities, the features of these locations vary between communities. Roll on or choose a\nresult from the Kuo-toa Ritual Sites table to inspire features and suggest adventures within a kuo-toa community.\nKuo-toa Ritual Sites\n1d8 \tThe Kuo-toa Community Features...\n1 \tAn arena scattered with weapons made from crustacean shells.\n2 \tA gallery of hibernating chuuls.\n3 \tA garden of mussels and tide pool creatures that whisper secrets.\n4 \tA hidden shrine with a patchwork depiction of a new kuo-toa deity.\n5 \tThe lavish chamber of an animal or monster said to be prophetic, lucky, or literate.\n6 \tA pool filled with jellyfish, eels, or fish roe that glow in organized patterns.\n7 \tA punishment chamber exposed to the light of the surface.\n8 \tA towering statue of a kuo-toa deity.\nKuo-toa\nKuo-toa loot ruins and raid communities near their dwellings in the Underdark.\nTheir shields are coated in sticky slime, which they use to disarm their foes, and\nthey employ slimy nets to entrap victims. They usually strive to take their\nenemies alive and drag captives to their hidden lairs.\nMost kuo-toa follow the orders of their more powerful leaders out of a\ncombination of faith and fear. In rare cases, a kuo-toa might abandon its\ncommunity to live as a hermit or wanderer. Such kuo-toa might know much about\nthe Underdark, but they live in fear of the strange gods they forsook.\nKuo-toa Whip\nThe servants of kuo-toa archpriests, kuo-toa whips—so named for their role in enforcing order among other kuo-toa—lead war bands in carrying out the\ncommands of their superiors. In return for their zeal, these kuo-toa are granted minor magical abilities and pincerlike weapons for subduing foes. In battle,\nwhips drive on other kuo-toa with threats of violence and burbling chants.\nThey came here from somewhere else and brought with them all\nthe rank and dank of the sunless sea. No one knows what they\nwant, and seems to me, neither do they.\n—TROSLI GARNETGETTER, GNOME EXPLORER\nKUO-TOA",
