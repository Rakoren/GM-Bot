By day, night hags use supernatural deceptions to plague their victims, shape-shifting to pose as other\ncreatures and make their targets believe the world has turned against them. By night, these hags reinforce their tortures with terrifying dreams. Once they\nforce their targets to desperate limits, night hags claim their victims’ tormented spirits, capturing them in sinister traps called soul bags. The hags then slip\nbetween planes of existence to barter stolen souls to vile magic-users and fiendish entities.\nNight hags maintain networks of nefarious customers and collect rumors from across the Lower Planes. These hags might part with their secrets in\nexchange for magic items and other wicked prices.\nThe Blood War—that ageless clash between devils and demons\n—helps ensure the balance of the multiverse. At times it makes\nunlikely allies, but never delude yourself into believing there’s a\nlesser of two evil. I won’t be thanking a demon for every day I’m\nspared a devil’s lash.\n—MORDENKAINEN",
