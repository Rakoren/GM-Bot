Manticores\ncrave the taste of humans, but lacking their favored prey, they eagerly consume other peoples and livestock.\nManticores have tails bristling with detachable spikes.

While\ngentle marids make homes amid springs, oases, and serene pools, tempestuous marids inhabit sea stacks, whirlpools, and treacherous coasts. Marids vary\nin appearance, their bodies reflecting the colors of the waves while distinctive fins and scales accent their features. Marids lend their powers and knowledge\nof the seas to those who defend the marids’ watery realms or who offer them pleasing gifts. Marids appreciate rare aquatic treasures, such as colorful\npearls, shell instruments, or delicacies from distant seas.\nMarids hail from the Elemental Plane of Water, where they live in wondrous homes drifting amid the endless ocean. Among these is the Citadel of Ten\nThousand Pearls—a coral sphere studded with dozens of domed theaters and libraries—and the air-filled, cosmopolitan City of Glass.",
