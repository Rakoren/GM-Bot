What cloakers call\nthemselves is unknown, if they refer to themselves at all. Though they’re undeniably intelligent, their behavior is often inscrutable.\nCloakers sometimes gather in Underdark enclaves, but they rarely build settlements or form social structures. Most operate as solitary predators, lurking in\ndismal subterranean reaches or abandoned dungeons—sometimes for months at a time—as they wait for prey to pass. They use their mottled hides to\nblend in with their surroundings. When unsuspecting prey nears, cloakers unfurl and attempt to latch on and then smother their victims in their powerful\nwings.\nCloakers delight in frightening foes. In addition to their methods of ambush, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves and emit surreal moans\nthat non-cloakers find terrifying in unexplainable, primal ways. Cloakers might antagonize explorers lost in the Underdark for days, terrorizing and scattering\nthem before attacking. They rarely converse with other beings, except to whisper eerie riddles to those they’re about to consume.\nCloud Giant",
