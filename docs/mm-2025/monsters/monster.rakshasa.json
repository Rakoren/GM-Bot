These chromatic dragons endlessly desire more—more magic,\nterritory, treasure, or whatever else inflames their cruel ambitions.\nRed dragons make their lairs amid perilous cliffs and volcanoes. Within, they amass and fiercely protect hoards of treasure, and many have perfect recall of\nthe hoards' contents and the locations of all they’ve collected. Should anything go missing, red dragons fly into rages. They don’t rest until their treasures\nare returned and the thieves have burned.\nRed dragons believe themselves to be the greatest of all dragons and, by extension, the greatest of all creatures. To them, pillaging and conquering are their\nright—treasures can find no more honored place than in their hoards, and other creatures are privileged to serve them.\nRed Dragon Wyrmling\nRed dragon wyrmlings are born destroyers.
