These tremendous winged yugoloths teleport around battlefields and into the air to bewilder\ntheir foes and attack with constantly shifting, Gehenna-forged axes—mercurial weapons similar to those favored by many yugoloths.\nNycaloths might command groups of mezzoloths and make pacts to serve arcanaloths, ultroloths, fiendish warlords, or wicked mortals. So long as they\ncan indulge their bloodlust, most nycaloths are willing to obey more powerful or cunning creatures. Some even serve competent leaders past the terms of\ntheir agreements to achieve long-pursued victories. But masters that lead nycaloths to defeat should fear these proud yugoloths’ retribution.\nNycaloths and other yugoloths frequently serve as mercenary forces in extraplanar conflicts that spill onto the Material Plane. Roll on or choose a result\nfrom the Yugoloth Incursions table to inspire the plans of a yugoloth war band.\nYugoloth Incursions\n1d4 \tYugoloth Mercenaries Seek To...\n1 \tClaim a portal with strategic importance.\n2 \tEnlist monsters as allies or beasts of war.\n3 \tDestroy a city harboring enemy cultists.\n4 \tLiberate an imprisoned fiendish ally.",
