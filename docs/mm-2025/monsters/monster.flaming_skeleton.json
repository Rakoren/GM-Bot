These toad-like,\nextraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality of their home plane of existence. While slaadi\naren’t inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often destructive. Many are driven to propagate\nthrough supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes typically are fatal for other\ncreatures.\nSlaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong slaadi dominate weaker ones. Blue and red slaadi\nrampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at the direction of green slaadi. More powerful\nslaadi have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source of chaotic magic from which the first\nslaadi originated. The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the\nmodron overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror,\nand Ygorl, the winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot to spread slaadi across the\nmultiverse.\nSlaad Tadpole\nSlaad tadpoles are ravenous, newborn slaadi. They hatch from eggs implanted into living hosts by red slaadi, but they also appear in great numbers in\nLimbo and other chaotic realms. Under most conditions, a slaad tadpole transforms into a blue slaad—or a green slaad if its host was able to cast spells of\nlevel 3 or higher—within 2d12 hours of hatching.\nRed Slaad\nA RED SLAAD AND BLUE SLAAD, ALONG\nWITH SEVERAL SLAAD TADPOLES, BURST\nFROM A PORTAL ON THE PLANE OF LIMBO",
