Some strive to end the curses that doom them to undeath, though\ntheir selfish souls eternally shackle them to their fates. Others, like the infamous death knight Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries, rousing\nthemselves to action only when something reignites their deathless evil.\nA DEATH KNIGHT AND ITS ASPIRANTS MARCH TO WAR AGAINST THE LIVING",
