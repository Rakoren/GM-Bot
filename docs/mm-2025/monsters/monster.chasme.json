With their fearsome claws, crushing horns, and fiery\nbreath, chimeras are tempests of ferocity, driven by their three heads’ conflicting instincts. Their heads agree on little but their desires to feed and to drive\ncompetitors from the rugged territories where these monsters make their lairs. When they spot prey, chimeras typically strafe foes with their fire breath\nbefore landing to attack with their fangs, horns, and claws.\nOwing to their draconic instincts, chimeras are greedy creatures that hoard treasures within cavernous lairs. They’re undiscerning about what they collect,\ngathering shiny objects alongside trophies and bones from their recent kills. Brave souls seeking to distract or temporarily appease a chimera can do so by\noffering it treasure and food.\nChuul\nChitinous Servant of Primeval Powers\nHabitat: Coastal, Swamp, Underdark; Treasure: Relics",
