Spells\nsuch as\nAwaken or the influence of other planes of existence might bring\nmundane vegetation to life, while other remarkable plants might naturally\nhave these features.\nAwakened Shrub\nAwakened shrubs can be any sort of small plant, from forest bushes to\nclustered flowers. They often appear near awakened trees or in regions\nimbued with primal magic. Some have whimsical appearances or foliage\nresembling rudimentary facial features, while others look like animate\ntopiary creatures.\nAwakened Tree\nSome awakened trees stand in still, meditative states for long periods, making them easy to mistake for normal plants, while others patrol regions of\nnatural power. Awakened trees are sometimes brought to life by influences from the Feywild, which make them colorful and endlessly blooming, or by\nShadowfell energy, which covers them with grotesque burls or makes them look lifeless.\nJust because we protect the forest doesn’t mean it’s\ndefenseless.\n—RIVERGLEAM, PIXIE",
