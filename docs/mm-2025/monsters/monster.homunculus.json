They flourish in the cavernous mazes of the Underdark, with its miles-\ndeep trenches and stalactite forests suspended over empty darkness, where they barrel through caves and swing across cavern ceilings.\nHook horrors feed opportunistically on plants, fungi, and any creatures that come close enough to hook. To perceive their surroundings, hook horrors\necholocate via a range of noises, from banging on rocks and their own bodies to vocalizations that sound like strange squawks, screams, or clicks. Only\nhook horrors know the meaning of these noises, but many people who explore the Underdark or live near deep-reaching caves have sought the sources of\nsuch sounds only to fall victim to hungry hook horrors.\nSpeed 20 ft., Fly 40 ft.\nMOD \tSAVE\nSTR \t4 \t−3 \t−3\nDEX \t15 \t+2 \t+2\nCON \t14 \t+2 \t+2\nMOD \tSAVE\nINT \t10 \t+0 \t+0\nWIS \t10 \t+0 \t+2\nCHA \t7 \t−2 \t+0\nImmunities Poison; Charmed, Poisoned\nSenses Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception 10\nLanguages Understands Common plus one other language but can’t speak\nCR 0 (XP 10; PB +2)\nTraits\nTelepathic Bond.
