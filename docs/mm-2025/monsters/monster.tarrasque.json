Different groups of thri-kreen have distinct carapaces,\nfrom the rocky shades of desert dwellers to the vibrant hues of those living in\nverdant lands. While their language has a distinctly insectile quality, thri-kreen\noften use telepathy to communicate, and groups can rapidly share a wealth of\ndetailed information without making a sound.\nThri-kreen Marauder\nThri-kreen marauders employ weapons made of stone and bone, such as the\nspear-like gythka and throwing blades called chatkcha.\nThri-kreen Psion\nThri-kreen psions harness their psychic powers to avoid danger and manipulate objects from afar.\nLegendary Actions\nLegendary Action Uses: 3. Immediately after another creature’s turn, the\ntarrasque can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The tarrasque\nregains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.\nOnslaught. The tarrasque moves up to half its Speed, and it makes one Claw\nor Tail attack.\nWorld-Shaking Movement. The tarrasque moves up to its Speed. At the end of\nthis movement, the tarrasque creates an instantaneous shock wave in a 60-\nfoot Emanation originating from itself. Creatures in that area lose\nConcentration and, if Medium or smaller, have the Prone condition. The\ntarrasque can’t take this action again until the start of its next turn.\nI would tell you now the tale of the first Ka’Cha, the first thri-\nkreen who knew and taught the truth: that the clutch is all.\n—Ka’Cha, thri-kreen knowledge hunter",
