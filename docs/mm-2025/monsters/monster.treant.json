Troglodytes consume almost anything,\nincluding bones, giant insects, and other subterranean dwellers. They prey on subterranean communities and those near entrances to the Underdark,\nstealing livestock and kidnapping residents.\nTroglodytes prefer to ambush prey and can change their scale color to blend in with their surroundings. They often climb along cavern walls or emerge\nfrom deep fissures to take their prey by surprise. Despite their stealthiness, these stalkers exude a distinctly repulsive stench.
