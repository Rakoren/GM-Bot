Whether standing unnaturally still or lurching with their awkward gaits, these\nblights can’t pass as either normal plants or woodland travelers. Once they spot foes, needle blights attack using their thorn-covered claws or by rapidly\ngrowing and flinging volleys of serrated, needlelike projectiles.\nVine Blight\nVine blights resemble humans wrapped in vines common to the areas in which they grow, from hairy ivy vines to flowering kudzu. They can cause plants to\nburst from the ground around themselves and entangle nearby foes.\nUnlike most other blights, vine blights can speak. They do so rarely, typically only to convey messages from their masters or to repeat the words of their\nvictims in rasping voices.",
