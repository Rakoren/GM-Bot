    "If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement. Difficult Terrain isn't cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn't. A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains any of the following or something similar: A creature that isn't Tiny or your ally Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or larger Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth Liquid that's between shin- and waist-deep A narrow opening sized for a creature one size smaller than you A slope of 20 degrees or more"
