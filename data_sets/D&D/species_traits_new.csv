Elf Created b y the god Cor ellon, the ﬁrst elv es could change their forms at will.

No longer able t o shape-shift at will, the elv es retreated t o the F eywild, wher e their sorr ow was deepened b y that plane ’s inﬂuence. Ov er time, curiosity led many of them t o explor e other planes of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane. Elves ha ve pointed ears and lack facial and body hair .
