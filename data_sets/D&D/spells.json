      "text": "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don\u2019t need to meet\nany requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\nObject Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn\u2019t a magic item. The object can be no more\nthan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\nInstant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all\neffects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.\nResistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This\nResistance is permanent.\nSpell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\nSudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of\nthe old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can\u2019t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other\nfeats or features.\nRoll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your\nlast turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally\u2019s failed\nsaving throw or a foe\u2019s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose\nwhether to use the reroll or the original roll.\nReshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the\nDM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish,\nthe greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be\nachieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For\nexample, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive,\neffectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly\ntransport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for\na whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god\u2019s\ndivine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your\nwish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image\nof her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.\nThe stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that\nstress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell.\nThis damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For\neach of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time\ndecreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this\nstress.\nARTIST: HELGE C.
