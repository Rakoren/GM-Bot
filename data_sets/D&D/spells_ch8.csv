You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature’s memor y isn ’t alter ed.

An illogical modified memor y, such as a false memor y of how much the creature enjo yed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dr eam. The DM might deem a modified memor y too nonsensical to aff ect a creature. A Remo ve Curse or Greater Rest oration spell cast on the target r estores the creature’s true memor y.
