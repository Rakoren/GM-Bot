Important:
- This is a TEMPLATE with a few illustrative example rows only.
- It does NOT include the complete PHB 2024 dataset or full spell/feature text.
  Populate the remaining rows from sources you own/licensed (e.g., PHB 2024, your D&D Beyond content, or SRD where applicable).

ID conventions:
- class_id: CLS_*
- subclass_id: SUB_*
- species_id: SPC_*
- background_id: BKG_*
- feat_id: FEAT_*
- spell_id: SPL_*

Tips:
- Keep 'version' as 2024 for all rows you intend to treat as "2024 rules".
- Use 'source' to track which book/SRD the entry came from.
